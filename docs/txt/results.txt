American Whitewater Fatal Accident Summary 
July-December 2015

This has been a quiet year for whitewater accidents, and the last 6 months have been especially so. From July to December 2015 there were only 3 Kayak, 1 Canoe, and  6 rafting deaths reported to American Whitewater. That count included 3 heart attacks, which are not, strictly speaking, river related. The yearly total, 34, was one of the lowest reported since 1993. This was probably due to unusually low water in the West and normal flows in the East. swims. I was relieved that the December high water in the Southeast passed without any casualties. Here's a summary. Please let me know if I've missed any fatalities.

How cool is it to have a paddler for a PM?  Canadian rivers were being destroyed by the 1000s ..98% of water protections stripped and GONE with the prior admin ...all of that protection is coming back now with Justin the new PM ..hopefully not too late!

It's 54f outside, 84f in the pool...  who knows, if it runs high enough you could practice your off-side roll and put it to the test on your way home... all without getting chilly :)
Saturday is looking like a perfect day to go kayaking. Sunny and almost 60. The winni is currently at about 700 hundred. Who wants to come out and play? I am thinking 10 a.m. at the put in

Bull's at 1 foot, fine for me.  Thanks Sam, it was an invigorating early morning run today.  Hope the water holds (I actually made it over the Flume upright!!!)
Someone left a paddle at the Bulls Bridge takeout.  I think it was the NY crew that was here in a van.  I have it at my house near by.
I came here to find out where the whitewater was at, but still haven't found any.  This has been quite a spell
I hear that this section has been run of spruce brook in litchfield county. Very easy shuttle and legal access points drops 300-400ft rather consistently before reaching the Naugatuck. Needless to say AW needs some serious updates for CT and MA.

Come join us!!!
I have a tear in my wrist gasket on my dry suit. Was hoping to have new gaskets today but they are a no show. 
Question.

Sunday's weather looking too good to pass up.

Is there anyone in this group who is a TSA verified Freight Forwarder in the Boston area? I'm buying two kayaks from a buddy and Delta can ship them from Logan to Portland (where I am) for $89 each, but the shipper needs to be a verified freight forwarder. Any help is appreciated!

NBYMCA Pool (kayak rolling practice) Time Starts Sunday December 6th, North Adams Y 12-2pm
I love my work at Safe Passage (domestic violence intervention and prevention agency) on a par with how much I love kayaking. Our annual  Hot Chocolate Run Fundraiser is coming up next Sunday. I'm still at only 28% of the goal I set for myself this year, So, if you can, please make a donation through my personal fundraising page. Even small amounts add up if enough of you can contribute. And, a great big thank you to those who have already given!!


The US House of Representatives is voting on legislation this week to enable the hydropower industry to more readily de-water the rivers that have hydropower dams.  The legislation enables them to easily over-ride the established laws requiring minimum flows and recreational releases. This has implications even for rivers with which we have established past releases such as the Deerfield River.  It won't necessarily affect the present contract that the gov't has with the power company, but that contract with FERC is currently up for re-negotiation and future releases could be imperiled.

The AWA is asking members to send a quick email request to their local US Representative in Congress to vote down the hydropower provisions.  I filled out the link in the copy and pasted article below and it took just 1 1/2 minutes to send an email out to my Representative (Richie Neal in my case).  You just plugged in your ZIP Code and a pre-written email posted to him popped out.
Click the link below to send your email. It really is easy!


Wish list for Thursday... Dead branch!!
Hey whitewater community! Back last winter I came here first to get advice on quitting corporate life and doing this kinda stuff as a job. While I got some good old fashioned sarcastic answers from people here I also got some great insight on how to start down the path I'm on now. So thank you to everyone who has paddled with me and helped me, I owe a lot of who I am today to whitewater kayaking and this group. 

I'm living up on the Penobscot now so if anyone wants to plan a trip, I always have an open door and at least a couch for a paddler. So start planning for next summer, the water is always on up here!

I just got an article into Dirtbag Paddlers on my journey and advice I have for anyone crazy enough to want to follow.

Weak ass rain storm. Any ideas for tomorrow? The falls which must not be named?
Whitewater park is still moving forward. Looking forward to hear the latest updates.
I'd like to do this, plus hit the Kenai and 6-Mile for an awesome variety of swift, ocean, class II/III kayaking and class V rafting... Having lived there 5 years recently, I'm happy to make our arrangements and act as guide - let me know if anyone is interested - summer 2016 - Alaska, like African destinations, need not be as expensive as the cruise/safari companies lead you to believe.

There is something special boating does to one on a cold day.  There is a feeling of joy, accomplishment, and appreciation of the crisp cold stark beauty around you.  Grateful to have gotten on the water today.

Any new info on the rumored Black Friday Fife release?
Bulls. Tomorrow. Crack o noon. Be there. Or don't.
This is how I try to get the point out we need more whitewater parked it there all day lol
I would say the First Black Friday paddle on the Deerfield was a success. Let's make this an annual tradition. The weather was gorgeous and the Gap was spunky. We had a group of 11 paddlers and another group put on before our group. Six of our group had dinner and drinks at Berkshire Pizza. Met two new paddlers. Thank you Trans-Canada; Bob Nasdor and Brad Walker. Sorry you couldn't make it Brad.  Thank you Don Williams for the bottle of hard cider to take home.
Okay so I just received my first dry suit in the mail I got a question what's the easiest and best way to stretch out that neck gasket its pretty tight?
I don't care if it's drippy or cold... anyone have any class II ideas for Saturday? Fife not releasing until 3p.
The search for whitewater is over...
November, Tville @ 1.8
Fife run tomorrow!! Who's coming with?💛🌊🌊🌊💛
Anybody for an early Bulls Bridge on thanksgiving. Level is holding was still 2ft yesterday
Happy Thanks Giving Everyone (click picture for video) ..thanks for all of the memories and for those to come :)
TBT...long, long ago we had these things called guide books. Before the ability to access internet river gages, we actually drove around checking hand painted gages on rocks and bridge abutments. In the process we also scouted the rivers. Anyone remember?
West River Meeting, Newfane:  The last public meeting about the watershed that includes the West River was tonight.  The Watershed Coordinator intends to take her plan - completed - to be signed by the powers that be by the end of the year.  She has heard our noise about continuing releases, but she said she does need to meet with other departments (Fisheries, etc.) in the next month to get their feedback on continued releases.  If you haven't contacted her, please send her an email or a snail mail begging (making our case for releases).  They need to be there before the end of November.  The address:

There were two vehicles parked on the Lower Ash takeout path. Making it difficult to use the path yesterday to take out. I ended up with a pricker up my nose and bleeding a little using the alternate route. Had fun on the river though. I haven't seen vehicles parked there before. Anyone else have this problem? Do you think they are sending a message that boaters aren't welcome there?
Great people and great time on the Ash yesterday. Thank you everyone for letting me tag along and showing me the lines! Happy Thanksgiving!
I love the Ash.  11 boaters and lots of fun.  Water at a nice level. Congratulations to Sue Vollrath on her pfd.

I did ask yesterday opinions on dry suits. ....made my purchase. .....now any suggestions on the best gloves to buy?  Thank you
Anyone run the w. branch of the beer kill? Think it will hold for tomorrow? similar to the Brodhead?   
Heading to Tville. Be there in about an hour
Anyone want to paddle the N Contoocook if it's remotely in tomorrow?  I'll bone zone...I'm in a welded boat anyway.
Is anyone interested in south baker tom?  Possibly upper pemi if it holds, or swift?
Knightville putin. Looks good, if you have the day off! That's not me but I hope someone gets out on it.
FarMill was pipe high this am! Drop after the dam after house is nasty. Scout or walk like me.
A lot of the kill Creek along 87 south of Albany look pretty juicy
Tville Wed 145-2ish if anyone's free. Will probably go at the same time Thursday and or Friday if nothing comes up
Be at Walker brook in NH in a few hours for Brunch
Watching the rain and pondering.  So what's for  Saturday. ?
Looking for a good dry suit. ...thinking about one of these. .....don't know if that's overboard or not. ....any suggestions?
Grrrrr......are we ever going to get the rain they predicted, seems like skunk after skunk this year!
Can anyone recommend a balaclava that is thin enough to fit under a helmet and won't bunch up around the neck? Intended use Wwater Paddling or Biking. Something like this;
Is anybody missing a Hydrapak?  I'm not sure where I picked it up this year, but I have a feeling somebody left it in my car at the Dryway or Fall Creek.
For all y'all in the drysuit/drytop market, Colorado Kayak Supply is having 20% off everything today, including that coveted Kokatat GMER Drysuit (though I'm preferential to the Icon). The checkout code is "PHATGRAVY". That's right, phatgravy.
Looking for a winter climbing partner at Central Rock Gym- Glastonbury, CT. I'm available Mondays, Thursdays, and usually try to do a weekend day too. Climbing 5.10s, top-roping only at the moment.
god forbid something where to run on friday, would anybody like to do some creek boating in VT/NH? Big branch, baker valler, upper pemi, new haven, etc.. probably not as far as conway crawford notch, headed most likely to the green release on sat.
Looking to boat on Saturday. If NH is in I'll most likely stay local. Otherwise, the Green in VT is releasing. Who's in? And by "who's in" I mean who is willing to go anywhere there's water on Saturday. I can even do Sunday too if Maine is in play.
Blue/white Recon 83 for sale $500 OBO. Message me for pics, located in CT.
Green River Release in VT

And again for the Saturday 11/21/15....... Verbatim from the management at Morrisvile Water and Light....

"We will attempt to run one unit full from 8 AM on Saturday November 21 until 4 PM.
We have been having problems operating the units at Green River this summer. One unit is not operable right now. The 2nd unit has been a little finicky. Therefore, as said previously, we will attempt to run one unit full on Saturday but I cannot guarantee we can provide flows for kayaking."

I am planning to be there early for a few laps.  Hopefully we'll have decent flow.  Also.... Parking arrangements have changed.  No more parking at the Power sub-station or Used car dealership... The cow pasture may be an option, but don't count on it with the rain predicted for this Thursday/Friday.
Maybe I'm just getting old, but flat water paddling just doesn't do it for me anymore. as William Nealy put it ," like Paddling Up hill".Haven't got the patience for it . Only moving and whitewater work for me now. Is this something that happens when you hit your 50s,60s ?      :)
Anyone free to paddle Sunday. Tville?
I need to put some river scratches on my new boat ASAP.
Fife Brook - From 9:00 AM tomorrow until 11:59 PM tomorrow, 800 CFS
Anyone want to meet up @ noon at the takeout. It will be the warmest part of the day.
West River & Connecticut River Advocacy Alert

As paddlers, we have all been frustrated and angry about the cancellation of whitewater releases on the West River. Over the past two decades, we have lost all spring releases and fall releases have been cut down to a single day, depriving thousands of boaters opportunities to enjoy this great river and depriving the community of millions of dollars in economic benefits. The reasons for the elimination of these releases include the failed Atlantic Salmon restoration effort, but more generally, by a mischaracterization of the West River releases as harmful to the aquatic habitat despite any real evidence to support that view. Many in our community have worked to educate both the Corps of Engineers and the state and federal agencies over the years, and in the past year, the Corps has restored a 2-day fall release. We thank the Corps for that and appreciate the efforts of Julia Khorana with the AMC who has worked with the Corps for many years.

The Vermont Agency of Natural Resources is in the process of updating its Tactical Basin Plan for the West, Williams, Saxtons and the lower Connecticut River. This plan includes the West River below the Ball Mountain Dam in Jamaica as well as the Connecticut River below Bellows Falls. The draft basin plan says nothing about boating on either the West or Connecticut River or the importance of these resources to our community. We have an opportunity here to make our voices heard and I invite members of our community to join with me in attending public hearings scheduled for later this month or by submitting written comments. We are asking Vermont to recognize the value of whitewater boating on the West River in the tactical basin plan and to support efforts to restore the Connecticut River at Bellows Falls through the hydropower relicensing process. They need to hear from us.

Excellent day riding the Bull. We had 13 paddlers on the first run, including many first-timers. Thanks everyone!
I found a very nice whitewater paddle with no name on it on the highway today. If someone lost their paddle and can identify the one I found contact me to claim it.
Great Jim Michaud  article :) 


There is/was interest in the lower winni for Sunday (tomorrow) at 11 am.  Prabhat, Kiran, Dan, Emilia, Andrew, you still interested?  Please confirm.
Is anyone paddling Bottom Mooose tomorrow ?
My Jackson Super Hero is for sale.  Follow this link to NPMB if interested: 
Psst... if your old paddle buddies had kids and disappeared from your life, send them here... maybe you'll see them on the water again!  Heck, if you have kids and missed 1/2 the Fall 2015 releases because you love them so much, visit here yourself.

Not looking to "poach" - just thinking that sometimes kid-talk can be a buzzkill: bootie-beers and binkies don't always go together ;)
Anyone want to do the lower winni tomorrow (Saturday) around 11 am?
Snowflakes    Falling.
I got screwed by the Sprite creek dam release cancellation, long story short, I'm flying into Albany tomorrow to get my car and boat, and am looking to run something on Saturday before driving home to PA. 

Anyone interested in Bulls bridge or anything else that may be running in NY/CT area? I have shohola as a back up but would like something new. 

Any takers?
Hey all,

I wrote a review of the Liquid Logic Braaap for Blister Gear Review -- check it out if you're curious about the boat. I've had a blast paddling it.

FAT TIRE BIKE INQUIRY:  Rather than put spiked tires on my mntn bike this winter, I'm opting for a fat tire bike if I can find one that fits me decently ..being only 5'2" with 29 inseam with my riding shoes on!  Any ideas?  I heard Specialized is making fatboy bikes for kids now ..but 24" tires 12" frame might be a bit small for me.  My current bike is 26" tire Rockhopper for women and it fits well.  Was hoping one of these might have a size to fit me:  Trek Farley, Surley Pugsley, Salsa Mukluk, or maybe a Specialized Fatboy.  Any suggestions?
Fife release all day 11/10... Work willing, I'm aiming for Noon. Anyone else?

Hi Paddling Friends!

It's that time of year again... I am writing to ask you to please support my participation in the Safe Passage Hot Chocolate Run fundraiser. Safe Passage provides comprehensive domestic violence intervention and prevention services. The Hot Chocolate Run, to be held on December 6th, is our annual major fundraiser through which we raise a large portion of the funding we need to provide critical services addressing domestic violence.

You can support me in this fundraiser by making a donation through my personal Hot Chocolate Run fundraising page by clicking the link below. If several of you can donate even $10.00 each, it will make a big difference for the bottom line for Safe Passage's budget.
http://www.PledgeReg.com/85256

I love the work I do at Safe Passage. So, if you can, please help me and my colleagues continue to be able to provide essential services for victims/survivors of domestic violence, and work towards an end to such violence.

Thanks so much!
Iif you are wondering where it's at, Bulls Bridge is holding at 1ft at the painted gauge, a good level. I'll be up there tomorrow.
What's the potential for the green releasing tomorrow too?
A new perspective of one of the rivers most of you know very well. Check out some aerial footage from the Deerfield this summer! 
I'm off to the Tohickon.
Hope to see you all
Any interest in the Winni, Saturday, around 11 AM?  Could be the only thing running, north of the Tohickon.
Hay any bring rubber down to the Tohickon
Any one going to the Tohickon release on Saturday?
What can you all tell me about the Toh? What can I expect? Am I in over my head? Will I die? Hahah seriously, any and all advice is appreciated 😊

Hey gang as the moderator of this page I have to approve everybody who wants to join. On a daily basis I get requests from people all over the world. When I look at their pages they have no interest in an outdoor or Whitewater boating. So I block them. I may not be very savvy with all of this so my question to you is why would these people want to join. Almost 100% of the time they are women. Are they trying to spam us in some way?
I found where the whitewater is at.
Is it possible to know in advance if the Winni will be running this weekend?  This morning it was about 600 cfs.  Isn't that a bit low?

Thanks
what's running this weekend to try my new paddlecat on?  It's still in the box and wants to get used :)
I found this info about the bridge construction on Tohickon and a possible portage. 
Hello, I recently relocated to Bergen county NJ and am looking to find paddling partners and local playspots for park & play or local day trips. Can anyone recommend anything close to central or northern Bergen county to run as I am clueless...
Winni tomorrow (Thursday Nov 5) at 11 am anyone?
Anyone know someone who can replace a neck gasket?
the seldom run "Ignorance is Bliss" on the Beerkill
Hey all. I'm back home in CT for a few weeks from WY. All boats in tow. If anything runs or there's a random release lemme know!  I'll go as far as ME. Pray for rain!
This should be good!
Who has any info about sprite release this year?
Ok Folks we asked and here is what we got....  Verbatim from the management at Morrisvile Water ad Light....

"We will attempt to run one unit full from 8 AM on Saturday November 7until 4 PM.
We have been having problems operating the units at Green River this summer. One unit is not operable right now. The 2nd unit has been a little finicky. Therefore, as said previously, we will attempt to run one unit full on Saturday but I cannot guarantee we can provide flows for kayaking."

I am planning to be there early for a few laps.  Hopefully we'll have decent flow.  Also.... Parking arrangements have changed.  No more parking at the Power sub-station or Used car dealership...  Park down/west on the Lamoille at the Fish and Game access area.

See ya there...

Cheers,
Ryan
Just got off the phone with DCNR in PA and it looks like everything is a go for the Tohickon release this weekend. They have my contact info and will let me know if there is any change. They are looking forward to having the releases again.
Looks like the dryway ran from 5pm today till 9pm at 950 cfs and will do the same tomorrow....hopefully someone can get a sunset run tomorrow
Wanted: Sprayskirt for Prijon Tornado. Excellent Quality that won't pop.
Toaster Mitts Lost:  Did anyone find a pair of large Toaster Mitts at the takeout of the Contoocook Sunday?  If so, they're probably mine.
Potential new hazard at tville. One of the slalom wires broke off the river left side above the play hole rapid and got stuck in the middle. While trying to pull it out the wire snapped and about 15 feet of it may still be stuck there. Hopefully it will be visible when the water drop. There were several other down wires that could be an issue when the level rises. Picture is of before it snapped.
Anyone heading down to the Tohickon Creek release next weekend?
Finally rained enough the other day to bring the ASS up to runnable for the first time in forever.  Here's what I call Mini-Crackpipe, because the wave is formed by a huge pipe along the river bed.  The eddy was "helped" multiple times by some kayaking beavers which in turn, improved the wave height, stickiness, and eddy service.  This was the lowest I would run t eh river and it's still a good wave, one of many on the ASS.  At high water, it's downright amazing......at this level, it's just front surf territory.
Can't find the right map to make sure, but isn't this near the New Boston run?

Took 11 am at the put in.
Anyone up for the Took tomorrow (Friday) around 11 or 12 noon?
Who's paddling with in a 2ish hour radius of boston tmrw (or sat)?
There is some non-trivial wood in play on the Winnie. There is a very large downed tree completely blocking the large river left eddy above Zippys (where people typically set up for the home stretch to the take out). Parts of this tree are also out in the main flow as well. All wood is easily avoidable, but that tree is definitely going to have to go! 

There is also a small log at the entrance to Alpine route against the room of doom. Currently not in play, but would be at higher flows. I could only see it from the eddy against the wall. The alpine route is still generally clear. 

Also paddled the Black Water today, where the wood situation is on a whooooole other level. Scout all the major drops!
Beerkill will surely hold for tomorrow was healthy and dropping very slow.
Tville tomorrow (sat) around 11?
Tville is just great today !!!!  3.10 on the riverside gauge right now and 73 degrees. Frikin' fantastic river day!! Ledge waves are sweet for SUPsurfing at this level.
Running the Warner River in about an hour, PM me if you're in the area!
Will be doing longboat laps on dryway and/or wbd tomorrow if anyone is around.
Bulls bridge. Is plant still offline. It was off last time I was there 2 weeks ago. 
If it is it should be around 1.5'. I am correct?
Does anyone have or has paddled a Jackson Karma UL. Thinking of getting one but would love to sit in one and or maybe paddle.
Want/Need To Buy: Elbow pads. Hit me up, y'all. My elbows thank you.
The Missisquoi is running big this weekend. The hydro is down and the river is up, so there will be some beefy flows on Saturday. Check with Michael Mainer for more info.
In the whites tomorrow. Anyone have any good class IV recommendations...preferably something that's holding water.
once again the berkshires missed all the rain. everrything else is running. the catskills, delaware watergap, vermont creeks, NH creeks coming up, MAine is too far
Anyone interested in paddling the North River from the VT border to Colrain, MA (take out at the school) tomorrow?

It's class 2 

I think it will pop up due to heavy rain tonight and tomorrow looks to be sunny and warmer
FarMill should be in, I hope. 3.95" of the wet goodness here at my place.
Anyone interested in leaving work early to do Crystals today
Beerkill should be juicy today and in tomorrow at the least as well. Gunks creeks running this morning but most will drop out by afternoon
Weekend:  What are people's thoughts?  I'm thinking that the 'Took and the Winnie will be runnable, and perhaps the Lower Ash.  Not sure about the flashy ones.
Rock River (near West R.) is running now.  Unless we get a lot more rain, it won't hold until the weekend.  Not sure if it'll hold tomorrow, but I don't think so.
Like DOT salt trucks idling before a big snow... This is your forecast for big rain in the Deerfield watershed :)
Turn Black Friday into White(water) Friday!
Bob Nasdor - think AW could get a Deerfield release for daylight hours on Friday 11/27? 
Maybe align with Class III sponsor REI's decision to 'opt out' of Black Friday?
There's been a consistent 1-hour release on Fife every evening lately, so it seems there's a good chance the water is there to save up for a healthy 4-6 hour release.
I'd be happy to write, call, etc anyone needed to spur it along.
all you need to do is leave a vague voice mail at about 5am saying you aren't well and can't come in.
Anyone heading to Tville tomorrow afternoon?
Beautiful view of the effects of climate change.  Also, FIRST DESCENT waiting for someone!
anyone have experience with Mythic drysuits?  Seems like great value at $225 (or $325 if you want to pee freely)
any trips going out this weekend?  Class IV boater with several class V under my belt.  Looking to paddle, let me know!
Someone got a photo of my van fully loaded at the Deerfield i think back in june. It was when we clown car'd folks inside and had a raft on top of the boats on the roof. Daniela Dragisic  remember?!?!?! Lol
is there anyone passing down the NYS Thruway to the Green Race that can transport a play boat down with them?
Are there any more releases this year, or are we down to natural flow / praying for rain?
Pyranha S6 190 for sale or trade for S8225, Sub7 One Ball, or similar.  I like the S6 but I'm after something longer.
For sale orbea occam29 it's a great mountain bike with a bunch of new parts New wheelset rotors and brake pads  The bike has Fox float  shocks in the rear and rock shocks recon in the front witch adjustable and also can be locked out while riding super fun bike to ride. 1200 or best offer
The Berkshires might go off this week. 
!!!
Any chance water is still leaking out of Fall Creek?  Doubtful I suppose I may just need to wait for Thu natural flow
The come along was nonproductive. Once we pulled the log 5' it was difficult to get slack to unhook it. I would need another chain to hold the tension  so we could get slack on the cheap come along to reconnect it. A chain saw would be 100% easier. 
The log is still at the bottom on the chimney rapid at the scantic.

Check it out. moosefest 2015!
What is the current bounty on a kayak paddle and pogies?
Like the looks of the Millbrook...def. on the List;
Fall creek tomorrow.  Enough talk.  I'll be there at 9 am.  That is all folks.
Is fall Creek releasing tomorrow
Has anybody verified with the dam operator that there will be a Fall Creek release this weekend? I have plans to head down if there is going to be water.
Lucky break.
Higher-than-normal release on Otis Fall Creek today in order to give NESS Race some decent flow. 
Great moment for a newbie like me to see a dozen or so experienced paddlers turn down an entire run... some were even geared up and ready to put-in - making the decision to bail that much more poignant.  
The statement at the end for the 2 runners was something along the lines of: That was one of the most concentrated 15-minutes of paddlng we've done, the run was good, but we are done for the day.
Good reminder for Dad to walk away from trouble and hopefully this little memory will stick with the kiddos too.
Has anyone been able to confirm New Boston is runnable this weekend? I read given two opposite and emphatic answers earlier.
Hey Alex Barham any beta on the 'playability' of this rapid on the Mohawk?  
...Alyson Slack Steve Brabetz  know of any good park n' play spots between Albany and Glens Falls?
Anyone know if fall creek is releasing this Friday?
So The Tohickon is supposed to release Nov 7 and 8.  Any interest in one or both days?
Amazing water survival trick (instant PFD from pants)
They found a warranty seal defect in my T3 Meridian Kokatat Drysuit, so they are either going to replace it for free with this: http://kokatat.com/products/dry-suits/hydrus-3l-dry-suit-with-relief-zipper-socks-men.html, or I can upgrade to the GMER for $189.  The Hydrus Meridian has the lifetime warranty of the GMER, so I'm wondering which you would do and why?  I've been very happy with the T3 Meridian which is the old version of the Hydrus.....reasons for spending the extra two bills?  Here's the GMER specs http://kokatat.com/gore-texr-meridian-dry-suit-with-relief-zipper-men.html
"It's #BackToTheFuture day! There aren't any flying cars, but the #hydropower industry wants to #UnlockHydro, dewater rivers and go back to 11/12/1955."
If legislation (H.R. 8) passes the House, this is what our rivers will look like again. If you're so inclined, now is a good time to reach out to your Representatives in the House. Otherwise, just share this picture around to show the truth of what the hydropower industry is after...

(I moved that pesky twig, then no more runs to shoot... wood doesn't just bother boaters!)
Fall Creek - Otis Reservoir MA - 10/17/2015
Wanna run Fall Creek tomorrow, and I have a good crew of interested folks like Boater Snmt, Samuel Stone and Kane McGuire, but we need a leader to show us the no no areas if possible, or we can just read and run.  can someone post the put in and take out addresses?  Thanks.
Anyone know if there are pics posted from the North branch Pcat run last weekend? There was a guy setup taking photo's in Buzzels. Be fun to see some of that!
Moosefest, y'all.
Anyone down for an afternoon paddle tomorrow or Thursday? Thinking sumners/hartland ... Not much else running. Dying to paddle but can't find a buddy :( People are saying it's "cold" or something.

I live in Lebanon, NH so I'm down for anything within an hour!
Dose this count as a rain dance?
Pyranha S6 190 up for trade for a Sub7 Oneball/S7 or an S8 225.  the S6 has new rachets.  I like the boat but want something longer/faster
FOR SALE:
New Wave Vulcan squirt boat- cut low for 150-ish.  Good shape.  $300
Anyone interested in allowing my son (age 22) and I (age 483, according to my son) to join them on the Lower Moose Saturday and/or Sunday?  We're from Vermont and haven't run the Moose.  We've run class 3 / 4 rivers like the Dryway and others in New England.
the warmest place today was in my drysuit, in my boat, going down the river.  Dang it's cold out there.
Anyone want to run the ausable chasm tomorrow?
Lost: GoPro Hero 3+. Yup, swam on my second run of Agers today and my GoPro and lanyard ripped off my kayak. There was no float on it, but if anyone by chance finds it please shoot me a message. I can identify it based on the number of videos on it, or the color of the lanyard/carabiner. Not holding my breath on this one, though, obviously haha. Thanks!
Who ran fall Creek today? All good for tomorrow?
They just turned Fall Creek on.
Can someone give me the address for the Mongaup put in?
Does anyone know what time the water turns on for fall creek this coming saturday? Also who all is planning on being there
Woke up this morning to snow. Moosefest here we go!
New Boston or Mongaup... I've never been to either. Which is more kid-friendly at good photo-spots? 

To give you an idea of what I'm looking for: Rodeo Hole rock is perfect (kids sit on flat rock behind me) and Zoar Gap is ok (kids sit up at road while I'm down on the rocks).

Mine are 3&7 - if anyone else has young spectators I'd be happy to meet up with their non-paddler to join forces on kid duty.
any other open boaters planning on running fall creek? it would be fun to get some video of the sports action.
For anyone looking to buy a liquid logic boat in the CT area, Jeff Hammond and I will be headding down for green race and have some extra space to pick up a boat or two from the factory, send me a message for more info!
I'm going east on i-90 and seeing a lot of kayaks going west but heading for the most I believe I'm jealous
Here's my NB PCat vid....used the Jackson Levator Mount on my Blackfly which was a cool perspective. Some good views of the "controversial" Buzzells Rapid, heading purposely at the mean 'ole curler. As always, 1080HD is best.
I just came north from the Carolinas,,,do you folks have Beaver Sharks in these rivers? We had many spottings this year on the Nantahala.
So I'm driving up 28 in NY today, went across a bridge and as all paddlers do, looked down and said hmmmm that looks runnable.  When I looked up there was a sign , Esuapus river. We'll I'll  be damned. Now I know where it is. Also looks like lots of restaurants and camping there also
Anything running in the northeast this weekend? Moose is a viable option, but would rather not make the 7hr haul if there is more water to be had.

Indian/Hudson 10/10/2015 with Merrie, Sam, and Ed Y
OK  so can anyone yet guarantee that there is a certainty  that the Tohickon will definitely release water for sure?
Deerfield River - Dryway 10/10/2015 - Dragon Tooth and Rodeo Hole
Everything on closeout Bomber Gear is now at 65% off. Most of the dry clothing has gone but it's a great place to pick up some bargain thermal and base layers for winter.
does anyone have any pogies or kayaking gloves i can borrow for moose fest this weekend by chance?  Be greatly appreciated!
A friend of mine who is not on Facebook is looking for a Jackson Fun Runner, or perhaps a Diesel 65.  Anyone who has one in good / very good condition and wants to sell it, let me know.  We both live near the West River in Vermont.

What time is dryway release tmrw?
Cancelled my maiden solo dryway run today. My little mustang died unexpectantly. Thankful she was healthy as a horse up until her last day. Adopted her when she was about a year old through BLM. Great 28 years riding together.
I can hardly believe that four blue morning glory blooms are still open on the the railing outside They always close as soon as the sun goes down behind the trees. They wide blue and wide open. How odd is that?
Anyone paddling the Fife tomorrow? I'll be at  take out by 11
Ausable Chasm is primed. Hit me up if anyone in the area wants to run. I have 50% shuttle, needing the other 50%. It's around 500cfs so the ride out won't be too terrible.

Downriver and wildwater fans: NECKRA Dryway race this Sunday, October 11th. Meet at the start for shuttle coordination and registration.
Deerfield Dryway
Monroe Bridge put-in
Exact race date will be announced when the water release has been scheduled.
Class IV mass start downriver race from the Monroe Bridge put in to the bottom of Labyrinth Rapid on the Deerfield Dryway. The Deerfield Dryway is Class III and IV whitewater so be familiar and practice the course before the race. There will be some safety on the course but all racers are responsible for their own safety and should be proficient in self rescue in difficult class IV rapids.
Contact elainecampbellkayaking@gmail.com for more details.
Headed to the Rouge River and seven sisters this weekend between Ottawa and Montreal if anyone wants to join. Thought I might try to hit up the Ausable Chasm on the way up tomorrow.

Randy J. Noble Wade Raymond John Ivanisin Sr., you were part of the email list from this. Maybe you were there?
River Beta questions, New York: In an effort to enjoy the peaking fall colors how low is the Hudson Gorge fluid? less interested in it being gnarly than being decently floatable. 

What is the deal with Woodhull Creek? AW says the class3-5 section is boatable very frequently. is the AW gauge accurate or is it a loose correlation.
FS: 2010 Jackson All Star-  It has a crack that has been repaired with roofing repair tape and other sealants. No signs of leaking with multiple river runs. $75 Located in central CT.
Looking to play around on the Fife Saturday or run the Dryway in my bigger boat. Sunday run Dryway again. Anyone interested. 
Plans can be flexible. Just want to take advantage of two days to paddle

I heard rumor that the Otis Reservoir was releasing this weekend, can anyone confirm that?
old town pack canoe, solo royalex, weighs 32 pounds.  good shape, $300.
Has anyone ever put a motor on a raft for flat water?  Could I put one on this for the lake when not in white water? 
Flat water question! Looking to buy my dad a nicer paddler for the recreational paddling he does - can anyone recommend something? He currently uses the low end LLBean aluminum one. Looking at paddles from the AB Sting Ray to the Werner Kalliste ... Not sure what I can spend yet!
This has nothing to do with whitewater but if anyone has an old moped laying around thats not being used and would like to get it out of the shed or basement we are looking for more war horses as parts bikes. Thank you in advance
When is the release on Fall Creek happening?
Need some help... When is the Sprite Creek (NY) release? I couldn't find any beta on it.
Just found some great pictures from the West on NPMB, many familiar faces:

Check on your friends down south 
Hey everyone, I hope some of you can join us after the North Branch PCat drawdown up in Bristol right near the playhole.  Playing with a fun organ trio at the Back Room at The Mill from 7:30-9:30pm.  This is a door gig, meaning, if nobody comes, we don't get paid so I'm hoping my paddling NH friends can make it out!  James Detzel and his lovely wife came out at the last gig and really dug it. Hey Laurie Cestnick, can you post that video of us at the Purple Pit?  Hope to see you on the river Saturday at at the Mill Saturday night!

Tubes at Fall Creek.  Present and accounted for.  There was a rumor that they may be replaced with a large rectangular concrete slot to allow more water through...The rumor was started by the dam operator last fall...maybe it is on the books for the next year or two... But for now our old friends are waiting for the water to get turned on...this photo was taken today.  When do they turn the water on?

Ball Mountain reservoir at 75 feet. Plenty of water for a weekend West release. Thanks #armycorps
So do we have a river to boat on Saturday
Just ran the Warner at 5.5 in my open boat, had a clean run through it all. Lots of rock dodging at that level, probably harder than over 6 for a canoe, but a dry hair day and good lines were had. One tree in the drop after meltdown, at this point easily skirted on the right. If it slips across the river, it might be trouble so scout the gorge in the am before you run it. Likely to be even bonier tomorrow. Thanks to Kane and Matthew for the run!
lower ash sat noon

There's going to be another West River release this weekend!
9AM to 4PM out of Ball Mountain Dam both Saturday and Sunday!

Dead Branch visual Friday mornng
So I'm looking at this river and I think she may run tomorrow.  Does anyone know the address of the putin? I'm having a hard time finding it with the information they give me.  Also anyone interested in paddling it? 

 On top of all that we have a hurricane coming in which means A LOT of rain.  I'm considering packing my car with food and water and driving around river to river to river to just paddle.  Let me know if anyone here is interested.

But number one interest is Locke Brook.

Anyone for ballfield-to-bridge Tville late this afternoon?
Still a large amount of uncertainty for the Joaquin storm track and landfall but starting to sound like a miss.
NWS Overview... 

"The track of Hurricane Joaquin is the main concern in the extended 
period as this will dictate the extent of any additional rainfall 
and wind late Sunday into early next week. Recent eastward/seaward 
trends seen in the UKMET...European model (ecmwf) and its ensembles are now appearing 
in the 12z GFS and its ensembles. What appears to be happening is 
separation between the developing upper low over the southeast 
states and Joaquin is too large for the upper low to capture the 
tropical cyclone. Perhaps more importantly is the upper low/pv 
anomaly near 27n/70w that retrogrades to the north of Joaquin this 
weekend and helps kick/steer the hurricane out to sea while the 
ridge to the north Joaquin weakens. There is still some uncertainty 
in the tropical model guidance however the overall trend is 
eastward/offshore with Joaquin. This is a trend we can/T ignore and 
will begin slowly diminishing probability of precipitation and wind for early next week."
Nevertheless we need to continue monitoring later model trends.

Ash is running
West River release this weekend!
Rain is finally coming. The ACOEs plans to build the Ball Mountain pool this week and provide a 2-day release on the weekend.  

Updates will be posted!
Doing Bulls at 2.30pm, meeting at the put-in
Schoharie Creek Boating Information Needed

The New York Power Authority is in the process of relicensing the Blenheim Gilboa Pumped Storage. They would like to speak with any individuals who have paddled on the section of the river below the dam to see whether there are boating opportunities there. I'm also interested in the area upstream to the Gilboa dam. I would appreciate if anyone with information on this would let me know. Thanks
soooo what are people planning to paddle this weekend??
An idea for a road trip. Anyone interested in doing the Indian/Hudson on Sat., Oct 10, then driving to the Dryway for Sun., Oct 11 final release???

Heading to Tville today around 3:30 if anyone would like to join. Perfect level for throwing down.
Low, Slow, Bony & Stony Scantic River Run Today. At that level I'd recommended hiking boots & a wading staff. All kidding aside...there's wood in the Chimney Rapid(S-turn) and some afterward as well. Straircase @ Powder Hollow is clean. Didn't check above @ Stoker's. River was very clean of trash thanks to the efforts of these folks...
Stuck at work today I promised myself I wouldn't look at gauges just drove over the Deerfield River in Deerfield and it's cranking what's running out there people

I am seriously disappointed by the lack of enthusiasm vs the south easts recents rain. Down there every body is freaking out and making plans as what to do with the torrential storms. And I think I just heard a pin drop
So it's raining a lot these next few days hopefully.  I'm looking to hit something Friday and/or Saturday.  Let's get some rowdy in.
Please everybody that is out today
a) be safe - watch for new wood, creeks haven't run in a while
b) post levels to www.necreeking.com (text to 802-746-4779)
Is this the stuff you guys use for foam outfitting in your boats?
Anyone down near Jersey looking to boat around there if there is water on Saturday?  What's around?  The Rockaway, the Wanaque?

Local guide Larry Lorusso will be presenting "Let me take you - the Grand Canyon" this Saturday, 10/3 at 6 pm in the Zoar Outdoor pavilion. Larry Lorusso is a photographer with over 40 years’ experience including working in advertising and publishing in the Sierra Club Wilderness Trails calendars. Larry took his first raft trip on the Penobscot River in the late 80's which began his journey as a raft guide on various rivers over 24 years. In 1996 he did his first river trip in the Canyon, where he found a perfect blend of his two passions, photography and rivers, and this passion continues even today. "Let me Take You -… the Grand Canyon" is an amazing photo show representing his many trips in the Canyon.
An assortment of runs at the top of the Dumplings, Buffy Spencer shot this. Feel free to ID yourself or others. Lovely day, lovely river, lovely people; hope we can look forward to more releases next year.

Lookin for some help! My friend who was supposed to take myself and another friend down the west tomorrow is having car troubles and can't make it, we are almost half way to Vermont (over a 5 hour drive), wondering if anyone would be willing to take us down/feed us lines! We are both strong boaters, however fairly new, we both have solid rolls (on and off sides) and have paddled the Lower yough, upper gorge, and salmon river! Any help would be greatly appreciated! :) thank you!
Any info on Fall Creek this year?
It's kind of funny reading an article about whitewater from someone who knows very little about whitewater... B for effort though... 
Old Time Carnage by Buffy: West River Carnage
This is some "light" carnage from back when there were multi day and multiple weekend releases on the West River. Many more people showed up, including those whose canoe and ragged wetsuit sat in the garage all year except for the release, plus the inevitable assorted Boy Scout troops.
Featured are lots of flotsam and jetsam, some accompanied and some not. Lots of flip, long swims stuck rafts, stuck rafter, a raft guide trying to imitate Errol Flynn, and a couple of ender spot oddities. In short, a good time was had by all.

No carnage (or music) today, but an assortment of boats and nice runs, slalom K-1 to open boat. There's a good view of a series of playboats making the eddy left/ferry right move, a dry run by the open boat, and the race boat doing a speedy slalom run. Feel free to ID yourselves or any guilty parties you can name.
All of this video was shot by Buffy Spencer using a Canon D10 waterproof still camera.

Thanks for the group add. 

I'm heading up to CT and MA this weekend and was looking to boat somewhere Friday (and maybe Eagle on Saturday). 

Would anyone here be interested in the Ausable chasm on Friday morning if the level stays above 300?  

Any other suggestions on places to go?

Thanks
Met a paddler from W.W.A. Luke,  by chance at Ogunquit beach Saturday.
Just heard from the Corps of Engineers at the Townshend and Ball Mountain Dams. As it stands right now, a One Day Water Release is scheduled for Saturday, September 26th. As it gets closer, we will hear more details. Considering how dry it has been, I guess we should be thankful we have the one day.
can anyone help me transport a necky chronic to the gauley from upstate new york? there are beverages in the deal for you.
Bulls tonight?
Heading to Tville now for a few hours if anyone would like to join. :)
You'll have to be a member of SA to see the video, but this is pretty high carnage on the snake.

Some years ago I shot a hilarious series of photos of Buffy making several attempts to get out of a C-2 at the Tohickon release. This video marks the start of her revenge, I'm sure she hopes for something more dramatic in the future.

It has been 3 1/2 years since I kayaked the dryway. Thanks Jason Jarvis for shadowing me today for three great runs. It felt great to be back on the water. I also learned today what a man is willing to do to find his lost keys (Scott Vogel). Hahaha! Peace!!

My liquid logic hoss has a 6 1/2 in gash in her front side. Do I give up on my darling or is there some sort of boat repair that can be done or someone I can pay to save her?

Going for my Maiden Voyage on the Dryway in my canoe.....look for spare parts!

We are looking for a river to try, his skill level is way beyond mine but hes willing to sacrifice his fun for my gain. hahaha. anyways, we were considering the west. I am a solid class II paddler with small III experiences. I do not have a reliable roll so more than likely I'll swim if i run into any problems. So far this year ive spent pretty much every weekend at the deerfield and the past 2 weekends at the lehigh for their bigger releases. 

is the west biting off more than i can chew? I know sections of it are....haha not planning on doing those.
From 11:00 AM tomorrow until 2:00 PM tomorrow, 800 CFS - anyone free?
We've got lots of great trips coming up this season in Nepal... Come and join us, you know you want to!

A final edit of beaverfest, includes go pro footage of moshier spillway, moshier falls, the raquette and my very slow beater race attempt on the raquette 

I received this email today regarding the west river release. 

Dear Jamaica State Park Camper,

 

As of this writing, this fall’s recreational water release from the Ball Mountain Dam is still tentative.  The release is scheduled for September 26 & 27, however there may not be sufficient water to support a full or partial release that weekend.  You can visit the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers website for the latest information.

 

The Corps is considering to moving the release to the weekend of October 3 & 4 or October 17 & 18 or possibly canceling it outright this year.  

 

Jamaica State Park is planning to run the vehicle shuttle up the West River Train the originally scheduled weekend of September 26 & 27.   If the release changes to October 3 & 4, the park will be open and there are still  some campsites available however there will not be a vehicle shuttle for boaters.   If the release is changed to October 17 & 18, the park will already be closed for the season; the main gate will be closed and no vehicle access or parking will be available inside the park.  

 

If you wish to change your reservation for the weekend of September 26 & 27 to a different weekend, you may do so where and whenever space is available.  If you wish to cancel your reservation for the weekend of September 25-27, you may do so and receive a credit for future use or a full refund without penalty.  We ask that you contact us by 6 pm September 24 if you wish to change or cancel. 

 

Thanks for your consideration.

Question: I have a hard time getting to the surface when I flip. I am usually fighting the flip and flipping on the back deck. A back deck roll would be great for me but still cannot do one. What do you do when you are deep in the water how do you get your body to the surface. Please don't say make sure to tuck because I know that. When you are on the back deck it is extremely hard to tuck.

H20 Line has 5500 release on 9-6 and 3500 release on 9-19
NPMB has 5500 release on 8-30 and 3500 release on 9-12

Another video shot by Buffy Spencer back in the 90's, this one features a high water run of the West Branch of the Deerfield in Oct. of 1995.

My buddy lost a pair of size 12 Fila sneakers on Fife today. He had the shoes in the boat and flipped. Thought they were tied in, but apparently not.

Hey all!

I wanted to put my feelers out there for a boat. I've been paddling playboats a few times a year for 3ish years now and would consider myself to be low end intermediate paddler. I'm hoping to find something that I can surf with but also run rivers like the west at ball brook dam in vt. I'm 5'11" and 165lbs. If anyone's got a package deal that'd be awesome. Advice is welcomed. On a college budget. Thanks!

Also! I'm in the granby area until Tuesday - ish then moving back up to dover nh area. Not a lot of time I know but any recommendations for nh whitewater blogs would be helpful as well!

JAMAICA STATE PARK INFO
White Water Release at Jamaica State Park
September 26-27, 2015
Whitewater is tentatively scheduled for Saturday and Sunday September 26 and 27. Shuttle times and prices will remain the same.
This year there is added uncertainty because there is a construction project at the Ball Mountain Dam which is adding a hydro turbine- this requires the water level to be held to winter pool levels. The project is about a month behind schedule meaning that they probably can't start raising water levels until September 1. It needs to come up 30 feet for the two day release. It has been unusually dry so far in the West River watershed which may not help. The ACOE is considering moving the release to a later date if there isn't enough water to do it on the scheduled date. But they won't know any of this until early to mid September.
If you plan to paddle Sunday, be sure to extend your camping reservations for an additional day. Thanks!
Jamaica State Park is the center of activity for the West River whitewater event each September as the US Army Corps of Engineers releases water from its Ball Mountain Dam. The controlled water releases produce ideal rafting, kayaking and canoeing opportunities on the West River in southern Vermont. The release is usually held on the fourth Saturday in September.
These events draw whitewater enthusiasts from around the northeast as kayakers, canoeists and river rafters all join in the fun of paddling the class II to class IV rapids. Thousands of people come to the park to watch the action on the West River and hike along the 3 mile long former rail bed hiking trail that gently winds up the steep valley.
Concessionaires stationed at the park’s day parking area vend food, equipment and gear. Jamaica State Park provides a shuttle service up the West River Rail trail from the day parking area to the Cobb Brook bridge. Shuttles operate as needed 8:30 am-3:30 pm on Saturday and 8:30 am - 3:00pm on Sunday for a fee.
Entry to the park is just $3.00 per adult and $2.00 per child and is collected at the park entrance. Camping space at Jamaica State Park fills quickly in advance for event weekends, so book your stay now.
Shuttles run from 8:30 am - 3:30 pm on Saturday and 8:30 am - 3:00 pm on Sunday. Fees are $15 single ride or $25/day pass.
* Please note that due to water levels and extending the release period over two days, there is a possibility that the release might be as short as five hours each day.
Oh man... Seeing all the posts from everybody going up to Maine.. and I'm stuck here in super drought California.. *sighs* At least I'll be running on the South Fork of the American.. It's no Kennebec at 8,000, but it's still fun!
looking for a kids ww boat for my 8yo. anyone have something cheap?
Dryway still releasing the 21st and 22nd?
Narragansett beach is playing movies on the beach every Wed night at 8pm
I need some new webbing for my ratchet strap that I busted. Anyone know where to get new webbing with a grommet? Or the whole piece cheap? Bliss stick gave me one free before they shut down but I busted the other one already. $28 seems steep. And I only need the webbing, ratchet plastic still fine.
Selling a Riot Booster 55. Boat is in good condition and complete inside. Asking $200. Located in Charlemont, MA.
Rumor has it that the West release has been cancelled because of work on the dam. Bob Nasdor do you have any info on this? The other rumor is that Riverdrivers will not be shuttling to the Dead put in next year. Too much DOT regulations for them.
Just another day at the Gap- kayaks, a couple of canoes, plus a few assorted root like vegetables.

Selling my Dagger Kingpin 6.2.  Playboat that is rated for paddlers 100-180 pounds, but I am 160 fully loaded and find myself wanting more displacement, so I think a paddler weight of around 120 would be more suitable.  $200 in Andover MA, you can try before you buy.

Anybody doing any easy boating in northwest CT today? I know they're low, but Satan's or T-Ville laps? 

just too pretty to sit inside...
LET IT RAIN!,,,,,,
Wanted:  Liquid Logic Hoss.  I live in Southern Vermont, near the West River.  Does anyone have a Liquid Logic Hoss they'd like to sell?
the rattle snake section of the housatonic is still pretty fun. i guess they don't divert any of the flow once it goes below a certain level. good alternative to t-ville
Thanks to those wannabe tubers Jeffrey Marquis and Bob Malinowski for a great day on the water. Does this mean you are also the mayor of fife Jeff??
Looking for a fun race and good food? 
OK so it's close to Wed.  Time for a thread.  Dryway Sunday??? Who's going to go out to play??
ARE YOU MISSING YOUR RED/BLACK TYPE V RESCUE PFD????

We accidentally packed it away this afternoon at the Dryway takeout....looks incredibly similar to Connor's PFD. Let me know and be prepared to answer some questions about its make & model. I wanna make sure it gets back to its rightful owner.

Sorry this happened...careless error on our part....
Snake is low but runable. I'll be there today. Anyone want to join?
Hey, let's practice our rolls.
Very unique whitewater kayak?


Dryway Sat or Sun?
Anyone planning on going to the Mongaup on Saturday?
do people still meet up at t-ville wednesdays even if its low?  regained my itch to late in the season.
The latest installment of "Old School Carnage", this time set on the Bottom Moose. Kayaks, canoes, C-1s, stand up IKs, and the occasional raft are featured, I start things off with a markedly bad run of Shureform in a C-1.  As mentioned in the Vimeo description none of the mishaps resulted in serious injury.

Cleaning out the basement sale… 

Island Waveski Fish $360.00

If you love to kayak and live near the ocean this is your toy.  Paddles like a whitewater kayak but surfs like surfboard.  Island Waveski shaped this to my order.  It’s their standard fish, shorter and a bit wider, super fun on small and medium sized waves.  Perfect for the beach breaks that we have in Maine.  Doesn’t slide down the wave like a WW boat, but rather carves and bottom turns like a surfboard.  Floats me (6 ft, 185 lbs) and paddles flat water more like a short board than a kayak, but on the wave it’s plenty fast.  The waist strap works well for rolling the ski and it’s very easy to release if you need to swim.  

Fun toy, but just don’t get to the ocean enough to justify keeping it.  ß

Here’s a clip of someone on waveski for a visual.      

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcIqmxj0jXk

Condition:

The ski did get a good ding when I failed and bonked the nose into the sand, going over the falls.  I repaired the ding so that it was watertight but not pretty.  It is good to go surfing, but someone with a bit more patience and skill could make the repair much better.  

Location:

Boat is located on Rowe Hill Rd. in Greenwood, ME… next town south of Bethel.

Headed to Tville after work today 6:00-7:00 pm as my meeting wraps up I'll have better details.
Sweet!  You all have an awesome local play spot at tville...especially when some dude by the name of David Silk shows up and throws down in a shallow hole!
Hi all! Seeking a cheap paddle, 194-196 cm. let me know if you have any leads!!
I'll be in the Adirondacks next week for a few days. Up in the Keene valley area. Hoping to hit the ausable chasm, couple other park n hucks upstream of the chasm too. Or other stuff in the area off chance of big rain. Probably Thursday- Saturday
Angst for sale. Boat is small. Cut for 105 lbs. would be great for a child or woman looking to explore squirt boating. The boat is solid with typical scratches. Cool green into purple fade metal flake. Price is negotiable and trades welcome.
Hi All...

A while ago someone posted a well made video of what seemed to be a first(ish) descent of a brooke called Thorne Brook in Northwest CT near the Hog Back Reservoir.  It seldom comes up...has wood...and eventually serves as the spillway for the reservoir.  It is just a cool looking place. It eventually dumps into the Farmington River about a mile and a half above Riverton.  Anyone one know where this video is posted on line?   Thanks for your help!
Shout out to anybody wanting to mess around tville...I'm in the area from WI, popped on her today, yes low, but I had a great time surfin, squirtin etc....prolly be there rest of week working out...met Sollie Hirsch there today, was an excellent host!
Out on the river this weekend.  Here is a video of some of the fun!!

I know it's only Monday.   But.....already thinking of next weekend.   How about Dryway for Sunday????
Saw this and thought somebody might be interested since it looks to be in good shape:  
Hey acquaintances and strangers. We are headed down the Dryway tomorrow in a double ducky and would appreciate you picking up the pieces after Dragon's Tooth. There is takeout beer in it for you.
Hay are we boating Sunday on the Dryway . WoHoooooo
Wave Sport Mutant for sale. If interested, make me an offer.
Folks heading up to Maine, would anyone have an extra paddle that I could borrow?  Mine is in bad shape, I don't trust it.  The shorter the better 191 or 194 ish.  Thanks!
Anyone from CT heading up to Maine on Thursday to do the Dead/Kennebec interested in sharing a ride? I'll be leaving from New Haven early afternoon.
Getcher funk on with Brooke Sofferman
(Brooke at the 2 min mark)
Does anyone have an old drytop or splash top (small/medium) they'd be willing to loan me for a few days for a trip to Maine? Got to send mine off for gasket repairs. Thanks
Just a PSA for everyone. The cops at the dryway are cracking down on parking in no parking spots. I got towed on Sunday from the spots at the put in. Ended up costing 150$ and a lot of time to get it back. Thanks to everyone who helped get it back while I was oblivious on the river/ at the takeout
It was great meeting all of you at Smooth Ledge today.

Becky and Dave
Harpers Ferry, WV
I have a women's medium Bombergear shorty drytop for sale. $40. It's got a front and side dry pocket. Arm gaskets are good but the neck gasket needs replacement. This is a very comfy jacket but I don't wear them anymore. Let me know if you're interested.
Tville today around 12:30pm
Headed to park and play at Tville starting at around 5 if anyone is around. 👍
Who's up for a Dryway Race Sunday @ Noon?
Ended up with limited time, hit the Tooth for a quick 45-min shooting session and was lucky enough to see these fist runs - keep going to about the 45s mark and you'll find a nice example of Rodeo Hole :) Paddle-on fine folks, paddle-on. (unedited 'cuz I need a new computer!)
Anyone going to T'ville tomorrow?  Thinking to head up there in the afternoon.
t-ville round 2:30ish
Jim Michaud giving me life lessons on the dryway in 2010

Tville today? Probably 1230ish
Chasm tommorow?
Anyone planning to go to the Nob race this weekend?
I noticed that the Mongaup has been releasing all week, up to 900cfs. Must be the need to run all the air conditioners. Anyone know who to call to verify that they will be releasing on a given day, or do you just assume they will on a hot day?
Watertech Easy Waveski in excellent condition.  This is a high performance Waveski with adjustable foot loops and seat belt, quick release, seat cushion and thruster fin set up.  Some minor epoxy fixes done professionally at a surf shop, but this thing is sick!  I just picked up surf boarding with my daughter, and would prefer to spend time with her on the boards, so I'm  letting it go.  Have everything?  Not this thing!  Requires good balance, but when it's on a wave, it takes off like a mothah.  Brand new, it would cost you $1200 after shipping and duty from Portugal.  I'm asking what I paid $700.  In Maynard, MA.
Ausable 
New wave squirt boat for sale $100. Been stored inside and shows little use. Will need outfitting redone. I may have a skirt for it but will need to find and locate in my basement. I live in Agawam MA. Send me a message if interested
I know that this is a long shot but does anyone have a rudder to an old broken sea kayak that they don't want?  I want one for a boat I am building.

Anyone paddling tomorrow or Tuesday?  Thinking Bulls if there's enough rain or t-ville
Anyone wanna do the chasm on Thursday?

First night with an organ trio of soul, blues and funk, and Saturday night with a guitar trio of mine including SOT Sean of Riverfest fame.  I will be hanging at the playhole literally 1/2 mile down the road Friday afternoon and all day Saturday.  If you intend on coming to the shows, I highly recommend getting tickets in advance.
Boston dropped the Olympic  bid
Rare Wavedog 200cm wood bent shaft zero offset creek paddle.  This thing is built like a brick craphouse, with metal reinforced edges, and truck bed linerish covering over the wood blades.  Some wear on the edges, but this thing could take anything a NE creek could dish out. $150 in Maynard, MA.
Werner Desperado Kayak Paddle for sale. 191 cm small shaft for easier grip. Carbon Fiber reinforced injection molded blades.

Paddle retails for $180. Paddle has been used twice and is excellent condition. Asking $100.

David Horgan  Home made river board (Pemi 1500cfs July 25, 2015)

Great summer paddle and picnic spot. Enjoy!
Anyone from CT going to the Penobscot race next weekend?  Looking for someone to drive up with to cut the gas cost.
I'm looking for sprayskirt advice for slalom boats...

Soon I will have (thanks to Justin Crannell for finding it) a Fluid Donsa which is a plastic boat. A sprayskirt will be required and I would like it to fit both plastic and regular whateverthey'remadefromnow AKA fibreglass boats well, too. (Just in case I get even more nostalgic!) There are various styles, bungee, o-ring, rand, etc, on the market but I'm not sure which would fit both plastic and glass boats best.

Any ideas? Thanks in advance!

Random cute paddling thing
I'm thinking of running the Mongaup on Sunday. It's a one barrel release which I haven't done but I'm told it's a fun level. Anyone want to join me?
Thinking Tville at 5pm. Anyone want to join? Otherwise doing Satan's.
Anyone know of anyone selling a freeride 57?
I recently burned a DVD from an old VHS tape of video shot by Buffy of many acts of whitewater carnage. I then converted it to a digital file and started to do some editing. Given the equipment used to shoot you can probably guess the quality. There are a lot of different rivers- Bottom Moose, Gauley, West, W. Branch Deerfield, Millers, L. Ashuelot, and this, the Deerfield Dryway. If there's demand I can edit and post some addition rivers from back then.

Anybody have use for a pair of dancers?
T-ville coming back into the good range (though I didn't think it rained) be there around noon
Hey everyone, we're getting fired up for an awesome weekend on the Penobscot August 1. We have a ton of super rad prizes lined up and most of them will be given out raffle style. Join us for a great time https://www.facebook.com/events/1497455173879006/
I heard a rumor there is a 6-7 minute video of the Dragon's Tooth with Jeff and I going through it, the other orange Duo (Adam & Can) and many others.  I've looked around but can't find it.  Can anyone point me to it?  Thanks!
Life throws you in different directions, then tunnel vision sets in. Spring thaw hit when I was in my final weeks of university. The draw of rising water levels was too great to resist. The last rapid in this video is called "Tunnel Vision," adeptly named from it's termination in an ominous tunnel. After Hurricane Irene, this rapid is in it's fourth iteration since Earl Alderson's first descent in the 1980's(?) - Check out this classic New England river
Planning to go to Satans kingdom tomorrow to introduce my brother to whitewater.  Probably 3:30 but not sure of the time yet.
Anyone see any womens tevas at the dryway takeout? may have been left there last weekend

I am going to fix a paddle with fiberglass.  It has a crack but doesn't appear to be weak.  I'm not sure if I should use cloth or just resin.  Anyone done this before?  It will be stronger with cloth but I don't want to change the way it reacts to the water (by changing the thickness and shape).
Anybody planning on rafting the Dryway this weekend that would have an extra seat or two on your raft??  There's a case of your favorite beer in it for you if ya do!!

Does anyone know what time Zoar Gap typically has water going through it on a weekend release day? Hoping I might be able to get a few laps in on Saturday afternoon.
Does the Dryway release Sunday?  The Zoar website says yes but the King of New York website has a note saying the Dryway will not release this weekend.  Just wanted to confirm before I drive.
Anyone getting out Saturday?
Greetings, Where-the-WWat-ers! Consider heading to the Black River Festival this weekend (7/18) where there will be a Whitewater King of New York race at.

Great photos from Patrick Rogers on the Dryway on the 5th of July 2015! 
A few tense moments, but it seems everyone ended up ok!  Got the last of my photos processed and can be seen on my website.  
Also c
