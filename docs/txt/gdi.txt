Got a question. What rivers/ creeks that are in the class 2 to 3 range that is near NOC and would be great for a beginner to intermediate class.  It's going to be in July  if it helps any.
Picked up a BeavR-2 cataraft today.  A few observations:  22" main tubes and raised 16" crosstubes.  Floor is 12" above the bottom of the main tubes which should allow the boat to go through bigger holes with less resistance.  11' 10" oblong main tube with fairly flat tops and bottoms.  Should help boat sit higher in the water.  Two pedestals with double thigh straps centered on the long tubes.  Secures you to the boat just like a canoe and doesn't require you sit side saddle. Width is 6'1". Floor can now be used to carry gear with six D-rings.  Two mesh bags attached to crosstubes for throw bag, etc.  Will provide a detailed review of how it handles after Sat run.
Big boof little boof
I have some yucko virus so trying out the BeavR2 in the living room
2 Free C2's for pickup: They both are in Central NJ. I'm about 10 minutes out of the way for anyone traveling between the northeast and the south.
Watch out for dem rocks.
The GA butt boater that parked his camper and trailer at the Tellico ledges takeout/middle putin, you are an inconsiderate Ass
Anybody want to paddle the ledges tomorrow? Should be enough parking!

What are the options for floatation on Octane 92's?  Obviously Fall Lines kick ass, but I'm broke from the boat.  Other options and size ideas?
The past few years it seems that an elitist level has developed due to advancments in boat, accessories and safety gear. Unfortunately, boaters of lower skill levels are being forced to stick to easier runs because the 'Elitist' are keeping their groups tight and not wanting to paddle easier runs with less experienced boaters.  Now don't get me wrong, I completely understand that you wouldn't take a class III boater down the Green for example.  However, it used to be that experienced boaters would be willing to paddle with lesser to help bring up the sport and strengthen ties between all levels.  Now I'm talking about actually helping them on the river, not just running shuttle with them.  I've noticed lately that Canoe Clubs still keep this old school mentality alive and present but there's not too much outside of these groups.  NOW I NEVER SAID ALL BOATERS ARE LIKE THIS but it is enough to be noticed by the other abilities.  Open your door to others and it will make you a better boater along with them.  Obviously as your ability increases so does your chances to run harder rivers or creeks but how can one become a class 4 boater if no one is willing to help them increase their personel potential.  Yes, they could go pay for instruction, but then you wouldn't know if that person could handle the stress of a serious rescue.  I am by no means calling anybody out, all I want is for the Paddling community to help each other.  And whatever happened to waving if you see a fellow boater?  Our lifestyle is one of a kind and is growing every day by leaps and bounds.  Teach a class, go to a roll session and just help.  We all sat in a boat for the first time and wondered what's this all about.  Somebody, somewhere took you under their wing at some point didn't they?

With that being said we are lucky being single bladers.  I can't say I've met an oc or cboater that is a true ass.  Glad to be one of y'all.
Tell me sumthin bout used up parking space......

American Whitewater Fatal Accident Summary 
July-December 2015

This has been a quiet year for whitewater accidents, and the last 6 months have been especially so. From July to December 2015 there were only 3 Kayak, 1 Canoe, and  6 rafting deaths reported to American Whitewater. That count included 3 heart attacks, which are not, strictly speaking, river related. The yearly total, 34, was one of the lowest reported since 1993. This was probably due to unusually low water in the West and normal flows in the East. swims. I was relieved that the December high water in the Southeast passed without any casualties. Here's a summary. Please message me if I've missed any fatalities.

Watauga River Guy Ford Access Update
01-04-16

As many of you know, we have closed on the Guy Ford Tract II property which will provide a long term access to the Watauga River at Guy Ford. The purchase is complete and this property is now owned by Watauga County. In the coming year I will work with county officials and other stakeholders to develop a sustainable plan to create a usable park and river access area.

Thank you so much to everyone who donated.

It is also not too late to donate. I will use any remaining privately raised funds to leverage the dollars needed for development. If you use this area, I think your name should be on the list.

Sorry in advance for flooding FB with this, just spreading the word.
A good day on the Little River yesterday (it was also Matt's comeback trip)
Ai yai yai! Will it never end?
Section 0 Chattooga. I didn't take many photos as the day started a little rough and we ended up a little rushed for time. Took a wrong turn and the trip was starting to look like the beginning of Deliverance, ended up on some four wheel drive trail that kept getting rougher and rougher, and had to turn around. When we finally made it back to the river we made our way pretty quick. Luckily the rest of the day was great. Water level was perfect at 470 cfs (for me anyhow). Saw two hikers and zero other boaters all day. There is a log in the bottom of Bull Pen falls. There was one other log in some small ledge. Other than that everything was pretty clear.
This is a perfect example of the difference between POV and real footage. The POV add a lot to the footage shot from the bank, but it alone conveys little of the true picture of what is going on.
Great day on section 0. Sorry for the crap quality video - I had a bunch of water on the lens.

Daddy's Creek Go Fast Day 2016 had great energy! We had 14 racers and many spectators come out and enjoy the event. Alex O and Jusbyn L got to share the Old English 800 for finishing in last place. Special Thanks to Chad and Sam for sacrificing Go Fast times to rescue a fellow pinned racer. Huge Thanks to all the sponsors this year! Your donations along with contributions from attendees will go a long way in making 2017 an even better event. #immersonresearch #unclelems #casualpintfountaincity #waldrensridgewhitewater #jackson #whitewaterofthesouthernappalachians #shockerzhandlepaddles

PS If anyone is out paddling Daddy's Creek stop at the beach, river right immediately above the canyon, and see if you can find Ashley PaquÃ«tte's journal.

So in lieu of a trip to Utah because non boaters suck, I want to head down to the Knoxville/Asheville area to check it out in the beginning of January. Anyone feel like taking a Yankee under their wing and showing her around and maybe lending a couch?
I know this canoe related but, flying the new Droid for 10 mins was well worth the hour and half it took to get it out of the tree.
Looks a little retentive.

The Baby is brewing. The western side of the NC mountains westward to the Tellico River have been sending the recent deluge from the sky toward our wonderful little town. The views of the river are beautiful and inspire awe. When enjoying the wonder of nature we as everyone to be respectful of the awe. Brenda Thomas Harris posted this short but terrific video. Live life to the fullest while giving credence to the awe.
Anybody want to try Doublecamp today?
When in 1994 and 1995 people were bitch about how the upper Ocoee was bein ruined by the building of the Olympic course, slam dunk was bein changed and they were pourin concrete everywhere, we told them "wait nuthun that is being done to it is going to last for ever. I ain't sayin this is the one where it reverts back, but this one will contribute to the time when another event like this will undo all the work of man to that section of river
Mexican open cane
Fred Davis Yi and I have both run this drop but neither time I did it was it this high
Who is running what today?
A friend took this; "The Screaming Meanies" 12/25/15
ATL folks...I bet there was enough rain to get Fulton County Bear going.  Or maybe Wehadkee Creek at the mill.  Here's some footage of me and Huck A Buck getting Bear a few years ago.
Seriously, what are the thoughts on paddling tomorrow? That's not blown up anyway. Anything in the Smokies? Or Island Creek? Can we even get to that one this time of year?
And so it begins. Remember if the rain caused the rivers and creeks to wash out the road bed ( something designed to stay put) you can guess what there are doin to their Rapids. That trick move where you brush up agin that horrible under cut or skirt by that dead sieve may have changed. Please take the correct  precautions.......get a buttboater to run it first.
Barring rainfall extremes overnight, the Little is my plan for tomorrow afternoon. backup : Tremont or........
Bear Creek,Al  usually runs around 200-300 cfs the gauge just went offline as it hit 5'000 cfs. its getting to look like this one is going into the record books.
Merry Christmas everyone! Stay safe out there!

NOT MY BOAT: 
As we were finishing our day the  brown wall came down the dries from that random spot near the bottom of the run.

Does anyone know if it is a pressure relief valve on the penstock tunnel or surge tank?
Getting vertical in Mexico
What's going on lately with the Pigeon Dries?. Is all the water at Waterville coming through there or some coming through the powerhouse? And is anyone going tomorrow?

Daddy's Creek Go Fast Day UPDATE:


Daddy's Creek Go Fast Day.  Please read and respond!


SOLD!
So I think I may have pulled a couple OC1 first Ds on 12/3/15. First being Upper Hurricane creek, two kayaks and my oc1, for first D for all boats. From there into Hurricane creek... This first D was taken a few years back by Adam Goshorn, Matthew Taylor Jones, and a few others(maybe you guys could help me confirm this) all in kayaks. From what I understand many of the rapids where clogged with trees on this run, and some portaging was done. A member of the original party and on my run cut out Hurricane after the original first D. This allowed us to run every rapid, all were pretty tight with plenty of hazard, I'd give it a solid class 4 for micro creeking. Anyways I believe I was the first open boater to make these runs, any info would be  appreciated.
I'll have a Demo fleet of these at SRS "Southern Raft Supply" for the winter. They are located in Asheville off the French Broad river. Hit Justyn up. They also have any piece of gear you can think of.

Fun from this past year.  Enjoy
These black Fall Line bags are going to look damn good in my green boat. Thanks Shawn!!!
Whitewater in Lenoir City
This happened way back in pre-ALF days
Some more cascades
Last Gauley run this year
So...who ran what today? What looks good Sunday?
My favorite run but a little on the lower side.  Tell you what, I'm beating up on my ZapPaddle and it's barely even scratched.  I'd be shopping for a new paddle about this time. Everyone already knows how good Fall Lines goodies are.  Enjoy my local Manky fun
Look past the boat and focus on the Japanese creek
Photos from my Glory Days, 1990 and 1993 I think...both at Bull Sluice...
Anyone know if the Ocoee will run tomorrow?
Santa is an open boater. And a lefty.
I need a new skirt for my Atom.  My old one was by Moutain surf and i want an identical replacement.

Can any Canadians get in touch with them?  I sent a couple emails that no one responded to.
Stay tuned I will be posting pictures of a new octane 91 with new bomber bags soon .Helping a friend out with the sale . Been padded half way down the nanty only . Calhoun GA
Anyone ever heard of a Northstar or north wood, fiberglass canoe manufacture out of Illinois?

Buying this boat today because it's in good shape for a fiberglass boat. Just wondering if it is a good boat design. The likes look good on it.
Seen in a coworker's office.
Just gonna toss this out here I'll be driving from Nc to Nh and back next week with rack space if any one needs a ride for a boat .
Ocoee? Tellico?
Your thoughts, please on Octane 85 vs. Option, as creekers, players, river runners. Seems to me the O-85 is equal in all respects but most paddlers are choosing Options. How come?
Adam you pulled your post? Fred is still a stand up guy
Chattooga IV tomorrow anyone?
ISO old wooden canoe paddles. If anyone has any they would like to get rid of please let me know.  Thank you.
Making the most of another 60 degree day, this time on the Watauga
Off tomorrow.  Let's go boating!
Some gdi approved levels on the cascades
Just a word of warning. There was a truck parked on River Road at the Tellico yesterday that was hanging over the line.  Please make sure that you pull all the way off the road.  That road is pretty narrow and we do not need to complicate things more by having cars and trucks sticking out into the road.  Makes it ripe for complaints from the locals about us having a good time on the river.
Would be nice to have one more experienced paddler join us for Noli Friday. I know the river well, but my friend who was going to help me show two others down may not be coming now.
HACKS, Housatonic area canoe and kayak squad
Anyone want to shoot for some upper nanty laps tomorrow? Been running for a week now, so chances are still good.
I can make it to ALF again this year.  :)
Only three days of paddling but it's better than nothing.
Can't wait to paddle with you guys.
Just finished my gunwales!

Thanks!
South Sauty with Jerrod Jones, Matt Todhunter, and Noah Taylor.
anybody know of good shape Pyranha Spanish Fly's that might be on the market? Super Fly and Quake also good.
I've got a day off tomorrow and don't mind driving, what's still running and who wants to get on something?
Anybody headed from or near Abingdon, Va toward Raleigh or the triangle that could give a C-1 saddle a ride?
I'm preparing to do some custom outfitting to my wife's Option and my Prelude. Adding foam sidewalls to the Prelude and expanding the existing ones on the Option. I've seen others add foam in all kinds of places and am thinking about that. I'd like to add as much as is practical to displace water and make the boats easier to roll. Is there a point at which it's too much? Or is there danger of getting trapped in the boat in a pin situation if  it's too tight in the cockpit? Aside from closed cell foam, I've considered adding extra floatation. Perhaps small kayak bags under the shins to also serve as ankle blocks. Anyone ever tried anything like this or have any good ideas? Shawn Alexander? Bob Britt? Matt Todhunter?
Clark if you think Tellico was crazy yesterday, wait till today. Ga. Buttboaters galore.
Anyone want to go bump down Big Laurel? It's at -3"
I have the ID# for the like green flying squirrel 95 that was stolen from Blairsville, GA 12/2/15 - Lps00006k415

LRC tomorrow anyone?
Island Creek Wood Report:
So today, Tyler Lowe and I ELFed into Island Creek to look for a friends paddle and to cut some wood. We discovered that a lot of water rolled through that gorge last week during all the rain. 
There was a log blocking the entrance to Compound Fracture last week. The high water has sent it toward the right bank. With regular flows, the log can be missed by going around the left side with no issues. 
There was also some wood above the ledge rapid at the cave. It's still there but has shifted a lot which opened a channel up. We also cut several trees on river right to further open up a right channel. However, there's still a log that will affect entering this rapid. 
Further upstream, there was a tree down at the top of a river wide ledge on the series of slides. The tree was blocking the main tongue of the drop which is preferred to punch the hole. We cut this tree out so its no longer a factor. 
The remainder of the run is fairly clean and open now. However, there are some trees along the banks in places that extend into the water but are easily avoidable. There's a few trees also that are easily duckable too. A lot of wood shifted around and there's a huge pile of debris on the Island near the end. However, it appears both sides of the island is clear. Keep yours eyes open next time you're in there but it appears to be back in descent condition compared to a while back.
Picked up an Austin Crane paddle yesterday.  The craftsmanship is beautiful and I can't wait to give it a try.
Whats the plan?
Damn I love this river I just wish it was closer to Veracruz
Lookin thru videos and thought this was pretty good. ALF Race.
Off all weekend!  Where is the boat riding going down???
NEW GEAR! Long Sleeve DRI-Fits and they are only $18 today only!!!!!

Tomorrow I may step into yet another level of desperato boating arrangements.  I will likely do "UberShuttle" for my very local Chestatee. UberShuttle boat and all.
Name these spots on the Tellico....
Only in Alabama. This is a shame
Piney River is a good minimum and holding.
Any thoughts on Caney Fork gorge suitability for open boats at current levels (1350 CFS)?

If you go to our Store and order, use the coupon code why the hell not and receive 10% off your order.   
If you're on the Tellico late this Saturday, come to our annual Candlelight Walk in the old downtown.  We will have food, Santa, the Grinch, and our famous Cookie Caper, where you can buy cookies by the pound.  Look for me at the Grinch's cave.
Anyone want to guess which barge these measurements were taken from?
Any takers for Tellico tomorrow
does anyone have an opinion as to whether Crab Orchard will hold thru Saturday?
Come ride the Roosters Tail..... Richard Guin !

We now have a store on our web site. Still have some work to do. It is getting there slowly but surly. Go check it out and let me know what you think.  
STOLEN KAYAK!! Lime green flying squirrel 95 - please keep a look out, bought new and still in great condition. Stolen from Blairsville, GA.
does anyone have plans to run middle Tellico this weekend?  think it will hold until Saturday?
well, I'm jealous of all the posts about how much paddling you guys are doing in the south... but up here we can justify having having one of these.  Yeah, it's got heated seats too!
The Stikine section of the Pigeon looks good to go.
If any Knoxville folks need a paddling after party, come out to Preservation Pub tonight.
Tellico 10 feet and Obed is at 48000 and both still rising
Lower White Takeout @ 8:30
Looking for a cheap oc-1. Can anyone help me out ?
Some of the best handcrafted paddles on the market! Made by a c-boater and can hold up on the river but, pretty enough you may want to hang on the wall!
Tellico at 6 feet and going up a foot an hour. Obed at 37000 and going up 4000 an hour
Just a reminder about Daddy's Creek...The Devil's Breakfast Table takeout will be closed this weekend to boaters Dec 3-6 (Thurs-Sun) for a deer hunt in Catoosa Wildlife Management Area. Don't pull a Louie and get yourself and all your friends a fine:)
She rolls like a dream!
Greenbrier holding at 1.9
Big Creek Via Will Butler. The top of the surge was at 2.5, and the bottom was around 2.1
For Sale:  Prijon Release C-1 very used but HTP plastic, Wave Sport ZG 54 C-1 in very good shape with primo outfitting, empty Riot Astro 54 empty ready for a c-1 conversion in great shape, small oil can.  Make me an offer, located in seattle and I will help you ship via am track, or DHL, by help I mean wrap it and you pay for shipping.
Greenbrier 1.9; it only rained a 10th of an inch overnight. Rain is on the way right now, but it takes about six hours for the rain to get from Charlie's bunion down to gauge. There's no way big creek is running this morning, but it probably will this afternoon
Anybody down for caseCades or Tellico tomorrow morning
Does anyone have a cheap C1 for sale? Looking for an older/beater boat that would make a good first C1. A paddle would be a plus as well.
Here's some more Dries footage.
I finally got to sneak up and check out Upper Big Creek. I'd like to get back on this gem at a higher level, but we certainly had a good time out there. 

Blackfly Canoes - Fall Line Canoes - ZapPaddles
Any other 9-5'ers feel like the rain is always just a few days late? :)
Tellico tomorrow anyone?
This rain might do it. Good chance Tellico will be run able till late spring
Greenbrier back on the rise. 2' at dark.
Cleaning off my GoPro, I found a couple random Pigeon Dries clips from when Judd and I snuck out there at between 1100 and 1200. Kind of wet in a canoe at this level
The hydropower industry is pushing legislation that is bad news for whitewater, and we expect a House vote this week. If it goes through, great paddling opportunities like the Cheoah and Tallulah Rivers will never happen. Follow this link to contact your representative today!
I have quite a few boats for sale, both canoes and kayaks that would make good C1s
Just a word of caution for Island Creek....a lot of wood was cut earlier this year and left to wash away to finish clearing the stream. Be on the lookout for those logs to be in new places. My hope is that they are now in the Emory. Just keep an eye out if anyone runs it today.
Greenbrier: 2ft

Austin Crane's wooden paddle is one of the best I have ever used. Cuts through the water like none I have ever seen. I don't know what he is using for the finish but it was so slick and smooth I felt for sure I would have to take some sand and rough it up, no need to do it. My hand didn't slip once and it has a good amount of flex without felling sloppy and not shoulder issues after a hard day of paddling. If you get a chance to try one out you should.
All the welding is done on old red. We've pulled the saddle out of the Quad A's and done maintenance on the pumps. Marcos needs to Re work the wood gunnels and cross thwarts, put it all together and might even get a test float out of it before it goes to it's New Mexican home. I used to be jealous  of Paul Fantettie having boats in two states now I will have them in two countries
Here's some Rebel water....and a little Yankee.
Made some edits for first time. Here's some "Yankee" water.
Just want to say that the Black Friday trip on the dries was one great time. Shuttle work out with the least possible amount of driving. Strong group despite the number of swims and good time all the way around.
Anybody have any tips for patching this airbag leak? The outer nylon layer is not punctured but seems to have separated from the inner layer.  Any advice is appreciated!!
Zoomie again
There is some hope out there now....
Ya I know it is old and we have all seen it but somethings need to be repeated
Just in case anyone is close to the Ocoee, it's defiantly been running the last few days at 1,000 or 1,100 be my best guess. Someone also said the upper was low flow but I did not drive up. Pretty close to normal flow coming out of the gate. Word is till Tuesday the 1st. Put in at rails takeout at raft takeout is good.
Did OCA's have this decal in the middle or on the rear?
Anyone whitewatering Sunday?

This shit is funny. Go read the comments from about March up till current. Corran bailed on a Kickstarter project, and is trying to pass the blame to the company he sold out to. A bunch of people that paid big bucks for a SUP are getting the shaft. Sounds like it isn't all his fault, but a good cautionary tale for you if you are thinking about donating to a Kickstarter campaign.

anyone own a bomber brand gauley drysuit? does the inseam zip cause problems when you're kneeling on a saddle in OC? in particular the woman's gauley?
Still planning on Chattooga tomorrow.  Hope to see some of yall there.  10 am at 76 bridge.
Any comparisons or general thoughts on the difficulty for what the Dries at current levels?  Also, any decent way of gauging / guessing flow, short of being at the bridge already ? (Are they still generating ?)
Thanks for any info or amusingly snide remarks...
When's Ain't Louie this year?
A quick clip from the Pigeon Dries last week with Keith Clark. Level was somewhere around 450-500 CFS. The water channelizes nicely at these lower flows and Nowhere To Land was the most exciting drop in my book. Special thanks to Vince Zappia for letting me try out one of his beautiful ZapPaddle creations.

Texas Falls in Vermont. I had to roll between drops 2 and 3 it was scary I was trying to push myself off the wall upside down with my paddle so I could roll up but my paddle kept diving into the under cut room of doom. Finally got some leverage and pushed off and rolled up. Plugged the swamped boat off the final falls. Went over the handle bars and kind of fell out of the outfitting. Swam around for a bit then I stood up got my shit.

Located in Greenville, SC but am often in Asheville and boat all over the Southeast.
Edgar and crew have made it easy. We just add a little each.  Let's make a showing to help assure access to river a lot of us use and love!

I gave $100 - seems a both to me like a lot and also not much for a river I love. I'm sure even $25 (or less) would make a difference), especially since I get the feeling part of it is that it'd be nice having a bunch paddlers listed on the donors list.

Guy Ford River Access Fund Update

For those who haven't heard. We are buying the Watauga Gorge Put In. 

Wow. So far we have raised $10,000 as of 11-24-15. We are about halfway to our goal.  This project IS GOING TO HAPPEN. A few of us are ready to step in and donate thousands if necessary, but it seems much more appropriate for everyone to contribute a bit, together securing long term access to the river and protecting the environment seems worth it.

So far about 70 people have donated. We have donations from Alaska, Alabama, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Georgia, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, Colorado, and Illinois. Several paddling clubs are also considering large donations. 

American Whitewater is planning a $5,000 donation as well, pending approval of the board. Mark Singleton and Kevin Colburn have been instrumental in this process from the beginning. 
Thank you to everyone who has donated. 

If you have not donated yet, please take the time to do so. I know several folks who just havenât had time yet. It would be great to have the majority of the purchase money before the Dec 1st County Commissioners meeting to finalize the purchase. However, we will likely close in January, so you still have a bit of time to donate if you cant get it done before the 1st. 

Take a minute to contact 1-2 friends. Many of us likely need a prompt so we donât forget. It would be great to see a few more names from the High Country on the donors list.

The Blue Ridge Conservancy is graciously donating their staffâs time to send thank you letters and tax credit information to donors, so we are keeping 100% of the donations, which is fantastic. 

Let me know if you have any questions.

What paddles do you use? And for what reason? A lot of shaft flex or not?
Great day on the Tallulah. Big thanks to Stephen Rayfield for showing me some of the lines. Here is Steve at Oceana making it look easy.
Anybody have an affordable suggestion for getting a boat from Vancouver to Toronto?
How many OC1's have fired this up. Vortex.

What seems to work best as a drysuit zipper lubricant ? I use bees wax but it doesn't seem to last very long. Is there a similar product for the gaskets.
I know it isn't even thanksgiving yet but is it really to early to start a ALF wish list? I know Daddy's Creek and Cane creek at fall creek falls  were two that I have been tellin the visitors they need to get on and got done last year. This year I hope we could get Big at the Ocoee, the Dries and Upper North. Of course the best run ever. Upper Santellia
I just joined the group. This is probably a long post for a Facebook group but here goes. I've been paddling for a little over thirty years. I paddled C1 and OC 1 in the early years but switched to K1 about eight years ago due to some knee issues. But now in my golden years I hear the open boats calling to me. I don't know if the knees will take it, but I'd like to try. Seems like open boats have changed drastically since I paddled one and I've got a ton of questions. I know all about the Royalex fiasco but I don't know a thing about the new plastic boats. They all seem to have the bulkhead thing. I always did my own outfitting and was a big fan of double thigh straps. I never cared for the Perception saddles, which is what the bulkheads look like to me. Always felt it kept my knees too close together. Also, at 6'2, 225 what would be a good boat for river running and a little creeking? Like I said, I'm pretty clueless as to 21st century open boats. Any and all help would be appreciated.

Hey, Ronnie Rimmer. Remember this guy?
Here is some information on a new feature for the Splash Canoe for kids and the Bulldog canoe for OC-1 paddlers. 


Lot of open boats on Tellico today
This boat started out on the car on the right. Normally when a boat comes off the car it's the car behind that gets the boat through the windshield bow and stern painters are always a good idea
I'm not in the south but I wanna know what everyone is running these next couple days? just curious.
Michael or Keith, any info?

Anyone want to Tellico tomorrow?
Omega, Bear Creek @ 11-inches.  Notice more than half the flow disappearing into the sieve on the left (just out of frame) at the end of the rapid.
Does anyone make a longer version of the hand paddles that would work in a pinch in a canoe?
Just a reminder, Catoosa WMA is closed Nov 19-22 so don't attempt the Daddy's Creek takeout or you'll get fined.

Watauga River Access at Guy Ford Road
As many of you know, the parking area to access the Watauga River at Guy Ford Road is privately owned. This means we could lose access at any time. We have been working to purchase the 2.3 acre property on the downstream river left side of Guy Ford for about 2 years. This is about to come to fruition, securing a permanent public access to the river. 

This site provides a put-in to the Watauga Gorge section of the river below Guy Ford Road, as well as a take-out point for Section 3.  In addition, this property will provide river access for fishing, swimming, picnicking, and other activities for residents and visitors alike.

A bit about the process
The property owner has signed a contract to sell the property.

The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and the Watauga County Tourism Development Authority (TDA) have approved large donations toward this purchase, covering over 70% of the costs associated with the purchase and initial development of the property. 

The Blue Ridge Conservancy plans to purchase this property and transfer ownership to Watauga County.

The NC Wildlife Resources Commission has pledged to assist with the development and supervision.

The remaining monies for this purchase will be raised through private donations. We need to raise approximately $20,000. This is where you come in! If you value the protection of our natural resources, and everyoneâs rights to access valuable outdoor resources like the Watauga River, please consider making a donation. Any amount will help. All funds raised will be used to support access and conservation in the Watauga River Basin. 

Please feel free to call, text, email, or message me with any questions.

NOT MY BOAT: 
The Bell Ocoee: possibly the worst whitewater hull ever made. Discuss.
Rich Moore glad you got on the dries, too bad the male boof sister said it was too low to have any fun.
Things that keep you from boating
I have created a new FACEBOOK page called The Tellico Blue Way to promote the addition of put in and take outs along the river for all forms of water sport and angling recreation. We have had a committee of volunteers and community leaders from the city of Tellico Plains,  Monroe County the state of Tennessee, TWRA,  the Forest Service working behind for several years developing a plan for family and even friendly access to this amazing river and river gorge that has many faces and personalities and is loved by so many people. Our goal is to make the river  more accessible for recreation while addressing property owners concerns. Please take a look at this page for future announcements about Blue Way expansion and hopefully Scenic River status. Afterward, LIKE and share the page if you will. Thanks
A big shout out to Vince Zappia and ZapPaddles for the use of all of those handcrafted paddles yesterday on Tahlula. It was nice seeing them handed to the openboaters just as they were starting their journey down the stairs. It looked like ancient warriors being armed to battle giants.
Thank you
Wade Harrison posted this of the dries this morning at 0730
National Wild and Scenic Rivers website needs a photo of the Horsepasture for the webpage. I know some of you gnar boaters have one worthy to share.


NOT MY BOATS: 
Bought a used dry suit. Kokatat fixed it all up for me. Yesterday when putting it on I tore the interior patch that is intended to  protect the zipper from careless stress like I gave it. Do I try to fix this or do I wait until the suit needs more repairs? It didn't seem to leak yesterday.
Does anyone in the know have info on what that water running down the mountain at the bottom of the pigeon dries was all about? Is their a check release valve/trapdoor that was opened on the penstock up near the surge tank?
I've been looking for a canoe trailer to haul the families fleet in Summer. I found this ad on Craigslist. Just look at all those boats??? Located in Lenior City, Tennessee. 
Not mine !!!
This is scary Stephen H Edwards I have one each of those, and a Zoom
Judd and I got on the Pigeon Dries today at what we would surmise to be around 1200 CFS. Pushy, fun, and very wet
The delta is, rather surprisingly, not *that* bad of a creeker
I have heard the Hiwasee Dries are running until March. I am interested in doing that sometime and would like any info on the run, how to tell the flow, best place to put-in, etc. Also it has been years since I ran the Pigeon Dries and I am not clear on how long that will be running and the best way to determine the flow. I used to have a correlation based on the Harmon Den low water bridge but I can't find it.
Tallulah tomorrow: hot lap when they open the stairs, then a slow lap meeting at the *takeout* at noon, tandem with Holly Reppert. Come join.

The new BigDog Dropzone OC1 plug has been finished, Pete has left out some of the finer design to keep the glass mould simple and thus stronger whilst we ensure its all perfect before going to the Alloy mould.

Another non-whitewater question.   Suppose I want to head south from PA for class I-II 80-100 mile canoe trip at the end of the month, what rivers should I look at?  I was thinking the Buffalo in Arkansas, but there is no water.  I may need an outfitter for shuttle and primitive riverside camping and scenery are a must.

Hiwassee Dries Running Today?  Parking Situation?
I see so much that everyone is doing that I respect and admire.  So much readily available video of the glory of the day.  Crusty old guy that I am I will speak of how it was in another day, back in the 80's, when Mike Miller had his shop in Roswell, and Bruce Hare had winter SE headquarters at the Chattoga Whitewater Shop, and what's his face (Roger?) was selling boats off the top of his car at the Ocoee.  Anyone's first Section IV was epic, to them at least, and the Ocoee had so many different measures of performance, like what did you do where?  And then we went to confront our manhood and otherwise bravery at the Gauley. Talk of a more serious demon at Russell Fork was heresy, and other witches spoke of the Cheat.
Noli Bear is being released. Check out Appalachian Bear Rescue.
Saturday the 14th: pigeon dries if it is below 500. Backup plan, Hiwassee dries. Or LRC if it holds. Or Tallulah.  All I know is Saturday is the day for me.

Yesterday was a blast!  Paddling in at 10 inches was fun. Jordan and Alex let all the kayakers know just what open boaters are made of. I got pointed at a lot and stayed upright, so I guess I did, too?
So who got the Ion?
Your OC1 champ at the Green Race, Jordan Poffenberger. Alex Vargas finished second
Steven got these shot of the Dries at 900. I stole them but didn't makes any money off them.
Jackson Levator Mount Perspective.  Works?
Hope nobody caught that!
Green Race: 
Vargas lays down a solidly sub 10 minute canoe time;
Poffenberger slays his own OC-1 time, taking another 50 seconds off the course record;
Poffenberger also takes a whopping 24 seconds off the C1 record, tying for the 6th fastest overall time.  Beast.

REVISED SCAM ALERT: I recently had this guy, supposedly a river guide from Bleckley, WV, private message me asking if I knew of anyone who wanted to buy 2 boats cheap because he's moving & must sell. His photo & information had recently appeared in several GA kayaking related facebook groups that I am a member of as a possible scammer, so fortunately I wasn't scammed...however many others have been. Lots of people, from WV to GA, have reported shady dealings with him like: him asking people to wire money to him 1st before he delivers the item; or that he has a relative who works at post office so he can ship large objects like paddles; & that several people have also reported that they drive hours to meet him for a deal & that he never shows; or he's taken money for a deal & says an emergency came up, & he leaves & never returns or calls. The items he is "selling" may vary...I've seen rafts, paddles, kayak, camping gear, etc.
Since the original scam alert that was posted on 10/27/15, his facebook page is no longer active, either due to him deleting it or facebook blocking it since it was reported as a fraudulent account. However, should he resurface again, please do not accept a "Friend Request" from him & if you are already "Friends" with him, I urge you to "Unfriend" him because he likes to troll your "Friends" list for potential victims.
IF YOU HAVE BEEN SCAMMED BY HIM: Please contact Officer Pack of the City of Oak Hill (Fayette), WV Police Department, and report you case & file a police report if needed. Their phone number is: 304-465-0596. You may also reach him via email at ohpdjrpack@gmail.com Also, please do not try to contact Jeff Johnson. Please let the proper authorities handle it as any interferences may hinder the case.
Best wishes to all & I hope this helps!

New whitewater sport
CAUTION - Water Bottle battery owners.

This photo is the lid that allowed water to get inside my battery and ruin it after less than 6 months.  There is almost no glue left around where the lid screws to the bottle, and the glue around the top where the wiring comes in isn't even completly surrounding the opening, so the wire was able to move in and out within the hole that was supposed to be secured.  Water could have gotten in from either compromised location.  The batteryspace people refused to replace my battery for no charge, even though it is clear that their assembly of the lid was faulty.  I will not purchase any more batteries from them since they don't stand by their workmanship.  I caution you to secure your lid in both places with tape and don't rely on the glue being adequate.
Okay. I'm tired of taking my airbags and covers out after every trip.  What is the general consensus-- leave them in all the time or take them out after each trip?   I'm afraid they may mildew some if I don't   Or am I being too anal?  Yes, I'm lazy tooðð

Late notice I know, but is anyone headed from Chattanooga to green race this week that could bring a saddle from Matt Todhunter to myself? Good Asheville beer is your reward...
Who's running it?
A little higher today.

Keith Clark when he sold his last Blackfly it cracked the next trip. Over the last nine months he tries to get just one too many trips on this one. Blackfly for sale, only welded once
What were the dries at today? Do we have a level estimate for tomorrow? How fast are they dropping? Only ever one run them, and really high, but I'm intrigued. It's either that or 19 inch green and that seems stressful.
does anyone have a copy of the second paddle snack Milt did long ago?

thanks Matt Haughee for showing us down and the sweet edit. we went back a week or two later and cleaned up the lines
This could be handy sometime - 


I have a question...does the monster holes on really big water tend to keep you in them as bad as our southern creeking style holes? I know that it is a weird question, but I watch kayaks wash through the large chunder holes on the Zambezi where I assume they would be stuck...
Imma check the Pigeon dries around 10 am. If it's running Keith Clark and I are going for it. Would be good to have one or two more along for the ride.
Anyone for Davidson? I'm 2 hours from the hatchery, and can leave at once.

Anyone from Asheville heading to the Ocoee this weekend? I have a boat that needs a ride - I'll pay for gas :)

I was afforded the opportunity last weekend to paddle the Zap Paddle (Vince Zappiaâs latest model 10/8/2015) canoe paddle.

As I eyed the paddle the first thing that stood out was the craftsmanship.  This paddle is truly a work of art.  My next response as I held it was how light weight it felt.  I then performed a flex test and was impressed with how flexible it was.  In the water the blade demonstrated a lot of power.  One or two strokes I was up to wham/bam hull speed.  It had good balance in connecting my strokes.  It did not take me long to adjust to the paddle.  The lower shaft which is more of a rectangular shape was appealing to my hand.  It was easy to find my comfortable hand position.  The cigar shaped tapered t-grip provides substantial grip to hold and the natural finish keeps the paddle firmly in my hand.  Donât let this light weight beauty fool you.  This is one tough paddle.

Thank you Vince for allowing me to enjoy this paddle.
Greenbrier is rising. 1.4 and the water is a kaleidoscope of tannins and multi-colored leaves.
One my d-rings holding in my air bags has come loose.  What is the best method for cleaning the area, gluing, and securing said d-ring?  which glue is safe for Royalex?  It's a Dagger rival.  Thanks guys...it'll be my first boat repair.
One has to wonder just how long they had been rolling with a single blade..
It's Lewis's favorite kind of post, counting the eggs
I don't know if this is the one but I remember  one where the guy said after doin it "it was big, it was fast and it hurt.

The Beavers got loose yesterday on Island Creek. I was planning to cut a few logs near the end of the run but was surprised to find a 28" hemlock had fallen across the rapid just below Cave Rapid.  It's located on the sliding drop with the tombstone rock on the left. My poor 18" chain saw was struggling. Tyler Lowe and I managed to cut all the limbs off of the massive tree and managed to notch a cut or two in it too. Let's hope the next rain event brings Island Creek up to a high level to wash it all down stream. Be cautious on the next run as I have no idea where these logs are going to end up. I did the best I could but was a little overwhelmed with such large timber.

Hello all,

Just a reminder that the Peachtree City roll practice sessions start on Sunday 10/25/15 (two weeks from tonight).

We will meet at the Kedron Aquatic Center in Peachtree City from 5 pm to 7pm. Please arrive at the facility about 4:30 pm to fill out paperwork and be ready to go at 5 pm when the pool becomes available for our use. Also, please be sure that your boat is clean - there is no hose available at the pool so you will need to rinse off your boat before you arrive.

The details will be the same as last year. The cost per session will be $6 for GCA members and $10 for non-members. You will also need ACA insurance which is an additional $5 unless you are an ACA member. You will need your ACA membership card or number in order to get credit for ACA membership. 

This is a very nice, large facility. It is large enough to bring your canoe or sea kayak to roll and still leave plenty of room for other people. The water and facility are heated but aren't hot in my opinion. Some people roll in just a rash guard but I am usually too cool that way. If you get cold easily you might want to bring a couple of layers with you the first time until you have an opportunity to see how the temperature works for you. There are nice changing rooms with showers for after roll practice.

Many times a group of us will go to Mellow Mushroom afterwards for dinner. You are all welcome to join us.

If you have any questions (or if you have a burning desire to come to Peachtree City and teach me to roll my canoe - :-)) please feel free to contact me at lshkayaker@gmail.com.

Follow up to last post so it's out in public. Don't know who won short oc1, I'm sure someone can inform. I'd be curious as to the winning short oc time as well and how it compared to the long times. Interesting to see Jerrod Jones times less than 30 seconds apart between boats, makes you wonder how much faster long really is against dry modern boats.
PPatrick Kellerdon't feel bad man finished fourth in by division too
Rafting on the green
Free to a good home: 1 very lonely Esquif Nitro hull. It is beat and would be a project boat. Come and get it, or I could possibly meet at a river. I will get some pictures up tomorrow. 
Trade for beer: Two float bags that hold air kind of ok. They fit the above mentioned Nitro and are totally repairable, I've just moved to Bomber Bags. 
$20: Canoe foot pegs for outfitting I no longer have. I guess they could go in a kayak too, but why subject yourself to that? 
Pump Bits: 1 Pump, switch, pelican case and battery. It was in the Nitro when I bought it and worked then, but I haven't used it since. It's yours if you pay shipping. 

Pictures will be posted shortly.
Ocoee Results

Greenbrier 1.9. Too dark to see if it's muddy
How was super max?
One of the high lights of the day was gettin to talk to Keith Sprinkle and seein the starter girl was good too
Second single sticker to leave the starting line fifth one to cross the finish line. Alex who started 60 second behind me passed me at broken nose in a ridiculously long boat. Wiggy who started 120 second behind me passed me at second helping. He is in a even more ridiculously and longer boat. Noah in a C-1 who started four minutes behind me passed me at slingshot. Ryan who started three minutes behind me finished 30 seconds after me. I waited on him at both smoke stops but was getting cold and had to start paddlin again. The guy in the Viper who started a minute before me I never saw him after Gonzo shoals. I did see Alex and Wiggy leavin the doldrums as I was pull in to them. Been a long time since I have the done the whole Ocoee without gettin out of my boat........I stayed in my boat for both smoke stops.
I just got a Hiawasse dries trip report sounds like a pretty exciting day
Is it possible to have a canoe that can do both a lake trip and Hiwassee type water for the whole family and their stuff? Maybe 350 lbs of people?

Anyone up for the Hiawassee Dries this week? Wednesday Thursday Friday?
ok! so I have a canoe. To be exact, I have an Esquif Nitro. It has nothing at all in it but 2 d rings and the cord that holds the bags in. I need to outfit it on very little money (college sucks). So how do i go by doing this? I don't want knee straps, i would rather have all foam and i also need some bags and i don't have the money to buy anything new!! give me some advice people!! i want to get this beauty up and running as soon as possible!!

Any help would be greatly appreciated.
No foot pegs or brackets were in this, Installing a set of less lengthy brackets should be straight forward. Suggestions? Using the Pyranha measurements as a guide.

Here is a Park n Huck in New Hampshire. this drop is Frogtown Creek in North Ga's yankee cousin. strikingly similar
So that anyone can understand, I have been out of the boating game for so long over legal issues of my driving status.  It is a simple matter that one cannot boat a river if they cannot get to the river with gear.  I am struggling with numerous legal issues which always come to involve money.I am so close and I look forward to seeing you all soon.

Big Creek running at 2.9 per Brent at 11:45AM
Caught the Toe at a prime level Friday. Most folk stick to the short gorge section but the section between hwy 80 and Toecane is a really special intermediate run. I want to call it Nolito but it has a character all of its own. At the right flow it's easily the equivalent of FB Barnard to Stackhouse, but in all my runs I've only seen one other crew above Toecane.
Greenbrier: 1.9 admins got their heads out of their asses long enough to open the gates too!
Hate!
No we still ain't got what we need here but the latest NOAA current radar is finally showing a good chance for somethin close to what they been talkin about since Thursday. The Pigeon dries would be my first choice because it has been so long since I have got to do it. However with out a solid visual the Tellico area gives us a wider range of choices, Tellico or Cittico with fair rain, Conasauga, North or Bald with really fair rain, Double Camp, Wildcat, Santellia, Yellow, Upper North or Bullet with really good rain also a secret one Richard won't let
me talk about. All 13 of those are one hour or less drive time.
The NPS bureaucrats in charge of the GRSM are a joke. Apparently they don't know how to read their own rain gauges or how to interpret weather radar before making decisions that affect the public.
Because of the fact that everything was goin to flash, and stuff was goin to be blown out, with biblical amounts of water and it going to be the water event of our life time, I decided to wait till tomorrow to boat when we might have more water. While I was at home I dug a hole for a post and despite the fact so many people were talking about how saturated the ground was, after the first two inches of dirt the ground was dry below that. Yano down closer to the WATER TABLE. Now in Jan I figure the ground will be saturated. It is still October her.
I definitely buy in to the self reliance of SUGYS. But sometimes the focus needs to shift to self-preservation, in which case it would become SUGYATS.
Look at the USGS gauge for Tellico now. Not straight up but pretty darn steep. 1.49 almost non desperate min.
Please look at the NOAA current Doppler Radar this is first time since all this started that we are gettin what we have been lookin for. Should this storm track not change over night we might finally get enough rain to do something good tomorrow.
Tellico has hit 1.3 and holding Watauga has quit droping and holdin a little above 400. Sounds like Cheoah tomorrow........oh wait
That is right AW said it was canceled.
Greenbriar Road is closed at Highway 321
Headed to big creek in the smokies now, should be a good level for the afternoon
Anyone boating today, where.
Anyone boating in the Smokies tomorrow on something a shredder can fit down? Seth O'Shields? Greenbrier? Our plan was for the New tomorrow, but it's not going to be coming down anytime soon. We're looking for something to hit on the way back to Chattanooga from WV.

So sense WRWW  is sucky now    what flow page is the best to use
anyone doing after-work greenbrier?
So did you all find something that wasn't "flashin" Tellico has stopped dropping and is on a gentle upward slop. I am not sure LOC's guess about Watauga hittin 1000 sometime today is goin to happen, or did he say 10,000?  I will wait and see what tonight and tomorrow brings but what has been billed as "biblical" and "the greatest rain event of our life's" proberly ain't. September and October are the two driest months of
the year. Hurricanes really need hit SC or NC to get the shit up. 500 miles off the coast is going to flood the coastal counties for sure the Mountain ones, not so much. Hope I am wrong, I mean there is a first time for everything
First run through Pillow with an Austin Crane creation. It is a fine piece of work.

If like me tomorrow will be the first time you will be wearin your dry suit or dry top for the first time this year you might want to spray the wrist and neck gaskets, both inside and out...tonight and again tomorrow morning.
Read on, if you care why "The canoe is also the vagina of the Mother of the Forest."

from Joan Halifax's The Fruitful Darkness: 

        A respect for trees is well understood among the Warao, who live in the Orinoco delta of Venezuela along the Caribbean seaboard. Wa means "canoe," and arao means "people": the People of the Canoe. The Warao believe that the forest is a tribe of animated bushes, palms, and trees. Some of them were given origin by old gods, others are metamorphosing, and still others have always been "tree people." The red cachicamo tree, used for canoes, is thought of as the Mother of the Forest, known as Dauarani. She is the guardian of the forest, and in earlier times, she prohibited the killing of large mammals and the unauthorized felling of palms and trees. 
        "The trees and palms, to the Warao, are like other people with whom they have kinship ties and trade relations. When a Warao man wants to become a master canoe maker, he must first receive an invitation from Dauarani, the Mother of the Forest. If he is granted permission to create a new canoe, he is in effect sacrificing one of the daughter of Dauarani. Before he cuts down one her daughters, both Dauarani and the victim, her daughter, must consent to the act. 
           If permission is given, the canoe maker-initiate and a shaman-intercessor approach the tree-maiden, who appears in the shape of a young woman with a comb in her hair and a necklace of blue, white, and red beads. Before the work crew arrives, the shaman-intercessor sings to her: "Don't become upset. Be happy and smile at me. I am like your own offshoot. I am the one you accepted. I am fond of you. I came to touch your body, to caress you lovingly." 
         The maiden smiles and replies. "You are a neophyte master canoe builder. I can tell from your new ornaments. Do with me according to your vision: Kill me and thrust me down on the very soil that raised me." The tree-maiden and shaman-intercessor continue this dialogue until the work crew draws near. She then enters the tree that is to be sacrificed. 
          The shape of the canoe, when completed, is like a vagina, and each time the man enters his canoe, he enters the daughter of the Mother of the Forest. The canoe is also the vagina of the Mother of the Forest.
Greenbrier: 2.2 and clear. Hard to tell if going up or down.
Just because most of the gauges and turning down I think that is just last nights no rain period. What we had this morning should turn them back up.....a little. Ya'll do realize this stalled front is goin to give us more water than a hurrican that ain't even goin tomake land fall is don't Ya?
When we see this storm tract, then we can start talkin about mega flows
Finally made it to West By God....

Has anyone paddled a Esquif Paradigm? I haven't heard anything really positive about it! Any of you like it? If so why?
Pulled this one off the rocks this summer...
Here's a question: Paddle length per height of person and why? Go.
Big creek: Low; maybe under 1', but it is hard to tell. There seemed to be a high water line on the concrete just under 3', but I don't see how that could have happened. Water was still clear. Rained steady during our Pigeon lap.

If this 3-day prediction is right, WNC is going to be going off like crazy this weekend.
Took a hard hit to my right shoulder on a creek Monday, didn't dislocate but in quite a bit of pain depending on movement. Whats the consensus on ice vs. heat?
https://youtu.be/j5JJ5SyyAw0 this was filmed Saturday at GAF. Sorry for the quality. It was recorded wwith my phone.
Greenbrier: 1.45 and raining steadily. Water is still clear.
For TBT, my contribution collection is titled "Young man in yellow helmet".  Clear Creek in the T-Slalom.  I didn't hang out long in eddies like that on a sunny afternoon for fear of impalement.   Coosa River Rodeo, 1990 at latest in the Vertigo.  Jawbone 1985 or so.  I'm apparently running sweep for this trip, according to that first aid kit up front.  The lead boat first aid kit  goes downstream at Jawbone before the trip comes down.
If your media player will allow you to play it in fast forward, it looks like someone stirred an angry nest of skittles.

Is there one more WFT release this year?
A go-fund-me has been started to help get a DIY internet gauge up for North Chickamauga Creek in Soddy Daisy, TN.  This is a true gem in the Chattanooga area, and the old USGS internet gauge was used to predict the flows of many streams in the area.  That gauge was taken down about 5 years ago.  If you've ever enjoyed any creeks in the Chattanooga area, please consider donating to get this gauge up.
the only open boat in the race! where was everyone?
Hey,  
Made it up onto the Gatineau and ottawa river this past weekend and thought you guys would like my edit. :)

I have a friend that has a detonator, and a old town scout,both these are true beaters trying to figure out a fair asking price he is still paddling the detonator. He will be at GAF and he will also have a rpm c1, a 6 person raft and a dagger impulse for sale just don't know what a fair price for the detonator and old town would be

Who is doing the Gauley Race?
Ok I just bought my first OC1 (Octane 91), but have a question.  How do I figure out what length paddle I need to buy without trying to find different paddles to demo?
Can anyone message me bad Bob wiggins number?
We are only 3 weeks away from the TVCC Annual Ocoee Race! Have you signed up yet? There is a cap this year and we are over half way there!


Anyone down for meeting up to run the Upper Yough on the 21st? Never been there. Hoping to find someone that is willing to show me the lines.
So I actually have a reliable roll, but I haven't had to use it very much lately.  I went out yesterday to the local class 2 run to practice in current just because.  I'm a righty and anytime I flip on my right side there is no problem at all, I pop right back up very quickly.  However when I flip on my left side I can't seem to get all the way over on my right, it was very frustrating, especially because this is a new issue, does anyone have any advice?
Has anyone ever heard of a raft guide named "Frosty" the goat man?
Does anyone at Gauley Fest have a raft with room for one tomorrow or Saturday? I have a coworker who is strong and likes good whiskey but doesn't paddle, would love to get him on the water. Thanks!
I have some roylex boats that are worn in spots. Are there any sites that show how to patch them?
Ok I just got my first OC1 (Octane 91) and have a dumb question.  What's the best way to store it?  I store my kayaks standing on their ends straight up and down, but what's the best position for my Octane?
anyone have a tandem canoe i can borrow for the Gauley Race? was not able to get my Dimension up here
Mat Howes, you can bring this to OUT Race if you must.

You know your in a boaters home when the utility room looks like ,,,,
This Tallulah thread has given me a headache.
TO BE CLEAR! The race was not the brainchild of either the GCA or AW....it was mine. I have been the volunteer coordinator for the past 6 years. I cannot believe just now ungrateful so many of you, on this forum (as I know it is not across the paddling community) are for all the work AW, various clubs like the GCA and all the volunteers have put into making it possible for you to paddle the Tallulah. The releases would not happen without the volunteers as neither DNR or GA Power have the staff to man the releases so please do not disrespect their efforts.                                                       
 Over the past 6 years a lot of paddlers have asked about a Tallulah Race. In an attempt to open up conversation as to the possibility of additional releases I approached DNR and GA Power about a Tallulah Race to bring more attention to the releases and further develop the relationship between paddlers, DNR and GA Power......showing them that the paddling community could police themselves and have a race and the releases go off smoothly with very little asked of them. We needed the pilot race to go off without any glitches so the first race would have been restricted but if we got an additional release date for the race we could have relaxed the restrictions and developed the event.   
I still think the race was a good idea and am sorry that so many paddlers were unwilling to give it a chance but do not blame AW or the GCA. 
This was just ME trying to secure additional releases.
Second day on the yough and working out my rust of not paddling sine being of July 
I saw the darnedest thing;  Jim Michaud pulling his shredder partner into the shredder by his life jacket. I thought that be a great picture until I saw his paddle partner (John) shorts were around his ankle after getting worked at f%#k up fall 
Lol
So no picture haha
Headed to west virginia today for Gauley fest. Anybody gonna be around? Looking to hook up and chill  with some folks. Where is everybody camping?

I overheard a guy explaining whitewater canoeing to another gent at Publix in Greenville today. I picked up the pace as I walked by.
Chris Loomis did such an incredible job putting this together and editing this! He actually makes it look like I can paddle :)  (I'm in in the yellow canoe; he's in the red one; Bob Robert Wiggins is in the blue one.)
Does this truck belong to anyone here?  Spotted at the Norfolk Southern training center in McDonough,GA
Thank God the Green, Russell Fork, Watauga and Gauley race are on a much easier and safer river than the Tullah. Can you picture the restrictions, rules, advanced plannin and organization that would be required to have a race on a river that dangerous and if anyone had died on those rivers.
Sorry for all the Covert posts but I'm getting a bit bloody excited!

I thought this might be some instructive reading for those who think negatively about Paddling Clubs, American Whitewater, mixing "politics" and paddling, etc.


Anyone else attending the ACA Swiftwater Rescue Conference in October?
For sale: Mohawk Probe 14. Tandem outfitting. Normal scratches, no deep gouges, air bags good, overall great condition. Hit me up with any questions. Willing to meet within reasonable distance....ga,nc,sc,tn area.
I didn't write the following but it is so true and buried so deep in a thread I felt the need to bring it here"Bill.....................I know you remember the days before the political Facebook rants, the over organized club boating wannabees, the unnecessary organizational extremes of the bandwagon, and the so called "relationships" we MUST have with governmental entities who in the end don't give two shits about whitewater or paddlers.  It was once about paddling just for the sake of paddling.  Then the cause heads entered the scene, the masses stepped in and had to give their opinions about everything as a way to distract everyone from the fact that they were too pussy to actually paddle, and the rivah became a political shit show.  It was once about paddling and nothing more, and it can be that way again.  But in order for that to happen, shit like this has got to stop.  Just get on the damn rivah, sit in your boat, and go back to the TRUTH of whitewater.  Until that day happens, I will continue to poke the Butt Hurt just like I have at every opportunity on this bull shit thread.  These people are the reason whitewater is dying."
Had a chance to paddle and surf on the Nantahala with Wendy Arthur and Mike Anderson on my birthday.  Here is a little video of some of my favorite surf spots.
Anyone around WV wanna paddle the upper G today? Headed to the put-in now!

Hey! How much longer does the back need to be for a c1 spray skirt? And how do I measure it? Like from where to where?
Oh yeah..
Stephen Walker, Laura, Donna, Tammy can you see how this whole Race thing could have gone so much better had you all come on here with a statement like "we tryin to get a extra release day and one idea to do it
Is to have a race, what do you all think and what could you do to help out?"  That is not the way it went instead the little sewin circle from a club with a long history of pissin off boater joins with a organization with a long history of shittin on boater and announced that there will be a race and the river will be closed. Just because the man pick a couple of weak and easy to intimidate groups to deal with on the water release doesn't mean boaters in general have granted you the power to speak for us. With less that 5000 payin member and a BOD made of of people who want to sell boats, whitewater gear, and boatin book they don't either. The next time you have a brain storm don't call the AW call the General boatin public get their input, listen to what the non clubies have to say, see what input you get from people who don't follow the party line. I think it was a good ideal and would have worked maybe, I even bet had you suggested that anyone on the river please pull over and take a safty break from 10 to 1030 that ya'll would provide us with some carnage to watch most people would have I know I would have. Laura it is also clear you didn't learn much from last year rant about the beer under the air bag but then how do you tell someone sumthin when they already know everything.

Don't ya'll think the question we need to ask is how many single stickers were in the 30 invited?
There you have it folks.
Blah blah blah. Go boat!
I am still confused why you AW member have to volunteer at Tullah? You pay club due to the AW who has a paid staff why ain't they handin out form and helpin the cops bust people for havin been and you all go paddle the Hiawsee?
This Tullah race bullshit had GCA written all over it, however if it does comes out that this is the work of the American Kayaker I hope of you who kiss their ass,think they can do no wrong, and represent all boater and  types of boats remember this. Personally I don't think even the American Kayker is that stupid......however a group of Ga. Buttboaters on the other hand
The GCA has just pulled the post about the race off their page
Boof Sister done went and boof'd Mt Yale.

Proudly designed and made in Knoxville, TN! 'Merica!
Where does one find the ferrule or what not to make a broken Carbon Bandit into a breakdown? I'm guessing it'll be a spring clip and something or other. Many thanks.
I'm ready, are you?
What was your best PFD this year? Big Brush for me.
Just down the street from Colorado Kuyak Supply.
Dunno who this is going thru Tablesaw, but his canoe had no floatation. #awesome
OC1 finals start at 50:00, definitely worth a watch. The wave definitely wanted to spit the canoes out, and some of the best canoeists in the world had zero-point rides as they figured out how to work with the feature that day. The winning rides are incredible when you realize how much control it takes just to surf Garb.


I had great times on river this summer, it was the time to spent a bit of time to protect my canoes with a roof ð

Hi GDI! Is anyone traveling from the Colombia, SC area to GAF Friday or Sat., Sept. 25-26? I'm trying to arrange a boat shuttle to save myself 7 hours of driving. Pretty please :-) with sugar on top!
The results of blue angel down the great white slide at beaver fest...
One of the issues when I paddle the Octane 91 is if I make a mistake and run a wet line the boat holds a huge amount of water.  Looking at the Option at 27.5" of width versus the Octane at 31" it is easy to see why.    The short term result is a very heavy boat.  As part of the solution I filled in the sidewalls with foam.  The interior width is now 19" versus 23" utilizing less than 2 pounds of foam.  It potentially displaces 8+ gallons of additional water which would weigh 64 lbs.  An acceptable cost benefit ratio.
Sure you have you just didn't know it so therefore you are infected. You are in and we are about the most non closed groups you will ever meet
yes, whitewater boater, but no I haven't paddled with a GDI member - someone on Reddit suggested people join the group as a resource for good oc1 videos/resources, etc.

Ignore my request if it's a closed group only for people who know each other.
Tomorrow is the last Ocoee monday release. Lets go boatin' y'all !!!

Question for the Octane 91 drivers who have experience in both the Gen 1 and 2 versions of the boat.  What are the differences, other than esthetics, between the 2 versions?  Specifically handling, ease of rolling, stiffness, and weight.
I reattached the bulkhead in my Octane after the glue failed on an Upper Yough run.  The screw going through the rear thwart into a dowel in the saddle along with inflated bomber bags held the saddle in place for the last 3/4 of the run.  What is interesting is how much shear force is applied to the saddle.  Check out the rear thwart screw.

We'll be heading up to W(BG)V the evening of Thursday 10/1 and will be looking to paddle the Gauley on Friday 10/2, and the New or something else good in the area on Saturday 10/3.  Maybe hit something between there and Chatty on the way home on Sunday 10/4.  

I haven't paddled any of these rivers or been in the area.  You guys come on out and show us some lines and join in on the fun.  I'd love to get more shredders up there together, but we'll paddle with anybody!
Seems like someone mentioned a new campground up around the Pigeon.  We wanted to go up there as this is the last weekend for it.  Steve wants to do the SUP  :-)  

Any idea where we can camp?  We will be heading out the night before and will probably make it the whole way, even though it will be really really late

I'm interested in resurecting an old friend. Not wanting to go totally crazy with the finish, but to get more pop from the old vinyl layer I am considering a light overall sanding followed by buffing in some beeswax. Is this an ''approved" method of caring for old royalex? She's quite long of tooth and long term concern is not a big concern. Thanks kindly- jason

I haven't paddled in 7 years. I was up to IV level paddling an Ocoee. I am now going to paddle again. I am 55. What recommendations do you have for me to be able to get back to doing one of my favorite creeks, South Sauty (solid IV) or should I readjust my sights.

Travis II Overstreet commented that I was old school smooth, I consider that one hell of a compliment from a WFO GDI especially with all the sabaticals I have taken since I began paddling whitewater canoes in 1993.

Various buttboaters commented to us today on the Upper Slocoee about the number of Tandom open boat on the Slocoee yesterday. You were noticed
Tandemonium was great fun! Wade and I had a dry hair day and hit the meat on everything except Double Suck. Remember the idea about Nevafull? Well, that 92 is a blast Always full of water. Wade was treated to dinner. He dumped the boat for us multiple times. :) Great paddling with everyone. Video and pics are coming.
If anyone is interested here is the schedule, and a link to watch live video for next weeks Freestyle World Championships. OC1 prelims are on Tuesday at 8-9 am. (Its a good way to avoid actually working on Tuesday morning) The Canadians, Germans and Americans are looking good out there!
So my johnson 1250 bilge pump has become slow. Is there any way to clean it or what? I have it out of the boat already
I can't explain WHY the saddle is glued unevenly but it is. Any suggestions on the best way to unglue the right side (leg hole area) and move it up so that it's even with the left side?

Kids paddling gear for sale.  My son has outgrown these. Size 6 nrs booties $15, sea to summit size small paddling gloves $10, and Camaro shorty wetsuit size kids large (60 to 90 pounds or so) $20. All great condition. I will be at the ocoee tomorrow if anyone is interested. The booties and gloves will fit small ladies as well.
I don't know the answer to this question so I thought someone here might be able to help me. What would be a fair price for a Savage Skeeter - decent shape, includes airbags?
Corran Addison is lookin for a name for a Tandom buttboat so many came to mind but Dumb and Dumber keep comin to the top, of course that would cause a lot of fight between the two paddlers in it.

2 new OCtanes in the truck.
also near roanoke, va --  this new wave acrobat, expedition layup acrobat. 200 bucks firm. great downriver sternsquirt machine. hasn't been paddled since late 90's, stored in shed. i'm 200 lbs and never could really bow squirt it on eddylines. great stern squirts tho. edgy as a three peckered goat but wings wide enough for good stability. took it down sect iv a few times, ocoee, kennebec, dead, sheepscot wave a lot. bought used in maine in '91. busted it up creeking in maine and then repaired it solid (needs gel coat). also, backpack straps: epic outfitting
Maybe the first time this has been OC1'd since psyco Dave back in the day. Happy to finally get enough rain to give it a go yesterday.
Nathan Zumwalt this is Iron Ring at about 800. I was probably a foot from the potential boof rock at most. Not much to see due to bad camera angle but you get an idea of the hole pit.

We had a ranger come up on us at diamond splitter today. Discussed proper safety locations on the river and let us know he's checking out the regular spots now. Just a heads up.

Eleven years ago Alex Vargas did his first Ocoee trip at the original Louie Fest, he wasn't a natural, or even a fast learner, but he has learned. Oh he hasn't missed a Ain't Louie Fest yet. Video of days anniversary run on the WFT to follow and as usual for all the Yankees they will be short shakey and out of focus.
Who's in/near Fayetteville WV this evening?
Anybody OC2'd WFT yet? I'm assuming a 92 was used if so..
I hear Alex Vargas did?..
Soon very soon
Anyone in the Asheville area who was at the Ocoee today or tomorrow and could bring a mountain bike back from a raft outfitter please PM me as soon as possible. Beer compensation provided.

stolen from Chris Loomis. swimming stouts in Mejico.
(Possibly) FOR SALE: one beat as hell blue option, will come with beat as hell, but still badass, bomber bags. Looking to sell my old one (still fifth Gen) and get a shiny new one sometime this fall, and I'm trying to line everything up ahead of time so I don't have to go without a boat at all. Boat has no cracks as of yet, although it is possible for that to change- if it does crack details can change, and it will be welded well. Bags are faded and have some wear spots, but still have many many miles of bomberness left in them. Boat will be for sure available after green race, possibly sooner for the right offer. If I can't get enough to make it worth selling here I'm going to leave it in Mexico in December, so drop me a message/offer/talk to me if you're interested and we'll work something out.
Wiggy post that one with the big drop and swim. Where they say"get your shit"
I stold this picture but I have no plans to make any money off of it
Alex this year at the race at ALF how about everyone is required to swim at the finish line! Wouldn't that give the SWR people a heart attack

Thoughts please.. for a newbie.. Mohawk Probe 12 vs. Bell Prodigy X and any and all thoughts especially including stability.  Thank you!
For those that thought C1 was something new. ;-)

Sigh, boating.  There's some good #Wookscat action toward the end of this Green lap from February.
Saturday I need to get out and paddle. Can I tag along with anybody on the Ocoee? I might be a shit show but I gotta do something harder than the nanty/cartecay to de-stress
Ok. Need some help. I was given an "old" Old Town 16 ft canoe. I've also been given the challenge of turning it into a tandem whitewater boat for $100 or less. Granted it's not the hull for any real whitewater, but mainly I'm taking on this project for fun and to learn about outfitting and such before I waste any real money. I installed the p cord for flotation yesterday. Now I need to find a way to either make my own float bags or a good safe substitute without breaking the budget. So far I'm in this for $5. Any ideas?
First few days in the new Octane 91 fresh off the aluminum mold. Footage from West Fork Tuck, Green Narrows and a bonus Rocky Frog clip at the end. This boat is a load of fun.
Thanks Matt Todhuntertodhunter for the awesome poly dowels
Big Kahuna at a splashy level.
I mentioned that I was putting a bulkhead into my Ocoee to Michael Bruce Lewis.  He said he couldn't remember seeing an Ocoee with a bulkhead before and to please post a picture. So here we have a Nova Craft Ocoee retrofitted with wood gunwales and thwarts made by Vince Zappia and a Matt Todhunter bulkhead.  Need to get another set of airbags because these are not quite large enough.
I think I may have already been a GDI,  but it was officially confirmed by Bill McKinley today.
This poor poor boat...
In 1986 I was a bagage boatman in Costa Rica working for Bryan and Kelly Wham of Virginia. All those two and Ron Mullen could talk about was John's Creek in Virginia and how it was going to open to boating any day. I understand they open it and a few other in Virginia up last week.

My girl and I started an apparel line. Cool, hand-drawn t-shirts are to start, more gear coming in later! Give the page a "Like" and share it with friends to stay current on our designs!

Yes I'm a kayaker. Some of these are kayak-based shirts. But we're working on new designs to show you knee-riding swimmers and beaters some love!
Marcos is that a snake in that tree behind you? Oh we will stop at the A & W for a root beer float BTW.
The senior ranger on the Ocoee ask me to do some PR work and get the word out about the new fence at the downstream end of the commercial parking lot.  He said that so many buttboaters, ok he may have said kayakers are takin out there, which the ranger don't have a problem with, however the Tennessee DOT has received a lot of complaints about people with buttboats coming up from
the parking lot and instead of using the gravel trail beside the road are walking the white line in the curve down to their car parked on the shoulder ( I bet it is mainly buttboater's from Ga.). So the DOT said if the Rangers can't stop it the DOT is going to put up guard rails and do away with the parkin along side the road below the commercial bus parkin lot. The Rangers don't want to see that happen, not out of love for buttboaters, I knowed him since 1981 and he
likes buttboaters about as much as I do. The reason he told me he didn't want it happen was that he counted and there were 33 car there today and if the guard rail goes up those people will just be findin other places on the river to park causin him new head ache. He said keep parkin there just carry your buttboats up the bank below that big curve. So if people keep walkin that white line in the curve it goin to be a lot longer walk because the DOT will put up a guard rail and do away with all that parkin. I noticed there is already a new trail up the bank been cut below the curve. Just tellin you what he ask me to put out.

FAILED rockspin. Ocoee River
So, in an effort to raise funds for a new to me boat, I am selling off some very lightly used climbing gear.......I can offer pictures and a more detailed list for anyone interested.........items include the following

2 harnesses
2 fig eights
1 rapell rack
2 ascenders
Several several caribeaners of the locking variety......and some shoes.....that should fit a size 11......
Thanks
Per the Louie's request..yes King this is a  fun and reasonable level to run. I did not post earlier here in GDI because it shows Kayaker's (and I know that gets a overwhelming negative reaction).
I am intrigued by my short time in the Esquif Zoom.   Felt like a wildwater kayak.  No stability when still, but go forward leaning on a chine and it was fine.
Anybody out there seen or made ww solo/tandem switchable outfitting?
I have a vertige x that the last owner had set up as a solo trad. I want ww outfitting, but in someway make it usable as a solo or on occasion a tandem.

Any ideas or photos?
Sooooo, I was trying to save for a brand new octane but i am getting very antsy to ditch my first and only boat......my very well loved impulse....

I have found a ledge fully outfitted for $800.00 that I'm about to jump in however I'm hesitant due to the cracking issues I've heard si much about........I hope to paddle this boat for a loooong time since money for boats is not in my budget.......hence paddling my impulse with fiberglass and gorilla tape for the last 4 years.....

So, do I jump on it?

Someone make me an offer on a different boat?

Thoughts?

Sometimes, kayakers CAN canoe.

Yesterday, RVA local kayaker Cooper Sallade decided on a whim to borrow an open boat and ditch the skirt for an evening lap down Callaghan Creek up north in beautiful British Columbia. In doing so, he joined Fall Line team member Robert Wiggins on the very very short list of people who have open boated this world renowned, classic gem of a run. Here are some highlights from his lap.
Where do yall get buckles from? I need a lap belt buckle for a c1

My wife and I went up to PA to run the Yough. Everything was running high, so a friend showed me a cool microcreek outside of Ohiopyle. This is Fike Run. It is definitely worth checking out if you can catch it. Sadly my battery died during the last mile.

I might look myself later this week, but is anyone familiar with the uppermost Soque River gorge that is just west of Lake Burton and LaPrade's? Micro-scale, but it looks like enough basin and gradient to show drops. Probably National Forest.
Question: How fast does the Ocoee drain after they turn the water off at 5pm?  I am looking to put on around 3:30/4pm on friday and am wondering if I will make it all the way to the takeout?
Who is the culprit in the Blackfly about a minute in?
I need advice.  I literally cannot be in the saddle of my L'edge for more than 15min without losing all feeling in my legs from the knee down.  I believe this is due to the upper part of my leg pinching the lower part and cutting off circulation just below the knee.  I've cut a lot out of the saddle already and I've tried raising the seat in an effort to reduce pressure on my knees.  None of this has helped...  Thoughts, ideas???
Hey, I'm wanting to trade my Romanian AK-47 for a canoe, it comes with a red dot, fore grip, five 30 round mags, 640 round sealed spam can, and whatever miscellaneous ammo I don't shoot before I trade it. Let me know if you are interested. I really want an open boat!
Viper 11 w/ wood gunwales for sale - $1200

I am selling a like-new Viper 11. It has 22 river days, 16 of which were on the Grand Canyon where it didn't see a rock. The factory gunwales and deckplates have been replaced with wood gunwales, and the saddle is a Blackfly saddle with thighhooks. The boat is in great shape, and has been garage stored the last two years. First pic was before I installed wood gunwales, second pic is afterwards.

The boat is currently at my parents' house in NJ, but if there is interest I can go grab it at the end of August. PM me for more details
So I am trying to locate vynabond in the can. It seems to have been discontinued? I need to glue some anchors in some royalex boats. Mondo bond from harmony doesn't seem as effective. But even it says its discontinued on the harmony website. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

So I'm heading up to Maine from August 15-22. My friends rented a house on the ocean in the south. I would love to hit a class 2 or 3 river while I'm up there and wouldn't mind driving a couple hours. Anyone up that way who would take me out? Thanks!

Seems some Green River narrows regulars can be the most arrogant river people i've met...the ones most arrogant act like they have never swam anything or will cut someone down so they feel bigger...
Yes, some people do get on this river fast and run the big ones fast, it's their decision to assess their risk and choose if the reward is worth it
maybe its that the boats are better and some people learn faster than others...
Still most river clicks are weird this one is no different...there are not so many of us boaters, that don't swim

I think it is safe to say that you all can thank this man, Frankie Hubbard, for revolutionizing the canoe industry and hull design.  This is a pic of Homie at Rock Island circa 1999.   Homie almost always had a dry hair day.
Russell Fork is 312, about perfect. Negra barraga, Keith Clark, Matt Todhunter, Lost Tribeities ? Could push my first summer Ocoee trip out to August. Charli Kerns you ever done it in a real boat?

Does anyone with a Prophet recommend it as a first boat for a small kid?  I paddled one years ago and remember it being squirrely, prob different for a 70lb kid though.  Any thoughts appreciated. 

Someone offered one to me in a trade but it's 5hrs away so we haven't test paddled it yet.

How's this for a canoe ad in the Atlanta CL.:" Epic Canoe - $500   

Grumman canoe 17 foot. I have used this canoe throughout my life. Even after my wife left me with the kids and dog, it was still there to comfort me. After I lost the house I lived in the canoe for 4 years. Fortunately the government couldn't find me while I evaded them for missing child support payments. During that time I floated down the hooch all the way to the Amazon river where I wrestled an anaconda and caught the elusive west Nile virus. After a month on the Amazon river I decided to paddle back up stream to the states. After a week of paddling I was ready to cross the Rio Grande. This was not an easy task, but after evading border patrol, I ended up on the Mississippi river. Making my way past many steams boats I stopped for a spell. After regaining my strength, I returned to my canoe to find that pirates had taken it over and were sailing it towards the closest recycling plant. The canoe being Made from tin would have set the pirate hefty profit and then they could have had several pints of ale with the crew. Acting as quickly as possible, I took the closest steam boat and began my pursuit. Knowing that they had 2 paddles, I knew my work would be cut out for me. After catching up a boarded the canoe and unleashed the dreaded west Nile Virus upon them. After reclaiming my only property I paddled to the Chattahoochee where I am now. This canoe will complete your wildest dreams as long as you have the heart to chase them. I accept cash. That is all.
Gold ball
Pumps? No.
Was at a paddle shop the other day and asked my 6 year old son if he wanted to start paddling whitewater on his own, and pointed to some kayaks. His reply (without my prompting) "No way - kayaks are evil". From the mouths of babes...
finished
Hiawassee dries are runnin at 2500 tomorrow. I have run it once at 1500 and once at 5000. Both of these were so long ago one was in an OCA and the other was in an Encore. On the 5000 run in the Encore, we had Diana Holder and Rise Calloway with us. This was Diana first time back on whitewater after she had drown on the Watauga and Sherwood had to do CPR on here and bring her back to life.%000 on the dries was a pretty good reintroduction to whitewater. Diana's ledge on the Watauga is named after her. I figure I would let you all know how it got it name before some johhnny come lately wants to change it to Diaper pin or Baby powder or something like they did with Hamburger on the Tellico. Oh ya anyone want to go with me and Clark tomorrow? Cabot Anderson, Jeff Richards

Thanks to John & Liz for the shuttle and taking Pixie for a hike. Oh yes, Louie hope you had fun digging moss & ferns ... They do look good in your gardens!
Sometimes things just work out. Today I got to run a true, quality first descent right in my back yard. I've been eyeballing this run for quite a while after fishing this section. Earlier this week, Jake Trotter, Joseph Alexander Gudger, Jon Oody, and myself spent all day putting in a ton of work to clean this run out, thinking it would be months before we would get to run it. However, an epic and rare summer storm had other plans, and we got to run it today. Not only did we get slide off its sick water jumps, but it gave us the opportunity to make some rain gauge correlations that will help with future runs. Stoked. Here is a short edit of some of the bedrock slides at the top. Joe and Jake also styled the first slide, and I'm sure have some epic go pro footage of doing so, but it was not captured on the bank camera.
Headed for Greenbriar. It's 10:45 and we're on 74 in Sylva. 
Join us, won't you?
Lost canoe paddle on the Ocoee. Last seen at Humongous. Carbon blade and lower half of the shaft, wood shaft and t-grip. Name and number should be on it.

Might head up to the Ocoee on Sunday,  if it's going to be below 3000 cfs 
Anyone have any idea if it will drop to 3000 or below by tomorrow?  It still looked pretty high from pictures posted this morning.
Could the people who reposted the news article about Carter take their's down. Since it is inaccurate it is very upsetting to the family.
Thank you for your consideration.
Damn did Big Creek into the Ocoee run? That is a killer run
Anyone have any knowledge of levels for the whitetop Laurel?
To anyone present on the rivah the day of Carter Worthington's passing:  A close friend of the family contacted me and asked for a report of what happened.  Apparently with all of the chaos they have not been able to receive an accurate report of the incident and do not have many direct contacts within the paddle community.  To anyone who has accurate and first hand accounts of the incident, please contact me and I will pass you over to the family representative.  The family is truly grateful for any and all help.  They are hanging in there and surrounded by family and friends.  Thank you.
Does anyone have any information on when/where memorial service for carter will be held?
My recollection of events:

I arrived at Greenbrier around 5:30 to see if anyone was there doing a late lap. I didnât see anyone at the take-out, so I drove out to the park boundary and sat waiting for anyone to show up. I saw David Mc pull in a few minutes before 6, so I followed him in to the third pull-out (above wedding beach). We chatted, then headed back to the take out parking lot. As I passed the last rapid right before turning into the lot I saw Carter floating. He seemed to be holding on to Greg Murphy's boat. I thought he was simply swimming him to shore, but soon saw that was not the case. His crew (Greg Murphy and Vince Davis), and another man (Barrett) who had swam across quickly started CPR on river right. I called 911, and within a minute Chuck Hester (the Greenbrier Ranger) showed up. I had already put on my gear, and as soon as Dave Mc got across the river I threw them a rope. At this point they had been performing CPR for about 7-8 minutes or so. They got him back in a PFD, clipped in to the rope then Chuck and I pulled them across. Chuck and myself pulled him ashore and within a few seconds I started chest compressions while Chuck manned the Ambu bag. We felt gurgles here and there. This went on for a few minutes till another ranger showed up (Steve Kloster). Steve took over compressions from me. Within another couple minutes Gatlinburg EMS arrived and started an AED, then loaded Carter into the Ambulance. 

Greg and Vince stated that at one point he was semi-conscious and said something about "floating", but quickly went back out. They could feel him breathing somewhat off and on when they were still on river right, and I noticed him moving his lips even from the other side of the river. Luckily we were in the flatwater below the take out rapid, which made evac easy and efficient. His partners had stated they were on their second lap of the day, that Carter had been having a good day full of smooth clean lines. He had seemed a bit tired during the second lap, and seemed especially sluggish as he dumped his boat between Wedding Beach and Take Out rapids. Carter has a pump installed in his boat, but apparently did not have a charged battery today. His crew stated that he was entering Take Out rapid and simply turned over. He was not underwater for a great deal of time. His crew acted fast to get him to shore, as did Dave Mc, and Barrett. All NPS/EMS staff were on the spot with follow-up care and evac. Within half an hour of the ambulance leaving we got word back that Carter did not have a pulse when he was placed into the Ambulance. Preliminary exams showed no water in his lungs, and ER docs stated it was likely a heart attack or Embolism that caused him to collapse. 

Please get training in swiftwater rescue and CPR. Consider taking a WFR course if it is within your budget, especially if you paddle in the wilderness.
What's the best way to keep prescription glasses solidly on the face?   I use neoprene Croakies that fit pretty tight on the temple/arm of the glasses.  Even with this system my glasses somtimes get pulled almost all the way off my face when i get beatered in a hole or roll in reallly fast water.  Short of using ducktape, what else do you use?
Having a hard time deleting this email...
All the boating I did today..... Like literally, all the boating I did
Tellico back up to 5.96 and it ain't rolled over yet
Just had a thought! CMT has Carter's paddle hanging in their main building (he was pretty excited about that - got a free room for it lol!), that means we get to see a piece of him every year at ALF! That thought makes my heart happy, hope it helps everyone else cause I know we're all hurtin.
Conasauga it seem to be unless I get a visual that Ocoee's big creek is going
Say, this playboat thing is pretty fun!
Who is paddling what?
Fantastic day on Cain / N. Chick.  Thanks, David Dehart for showing us the lines, and thanks Noah Taylor for coming up to boat with me!
Are the trees out of the road along Citico?
Did a hurrican hit North Carolina and some one forgot to tell us? We don't normally have rain like this in July. Steve Arnold thanks for bring the rain but you could have left the cold weather back in Canada
Where to tomorrow? Lemme know so I can go to sleep in time.
When kayaks follow canoes...
Chad Lewis got a true first descent today on a river he has been wanting for a long time. 600 ft per mile section of north river. Wednesday this week they cleaned 3 miles of it of wood. Starts out with three 30 foot+ drops into a mini gorge then the rock type changes from bedrock to boulder garden type run. Video to follow
Do not go gentle into that good night,
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

...

Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,
And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,
Do not go gentle into that good night.

               --Dylan Thomas
Everyone on the New River Gorge will miss you, Carter Worthington. My story with you is too short, but it will be memorable.
For anyone who wasn't there, this is the text I received this morning containing more details of yesterday's tragedy. 

" The family wanted everyone to know the truth about what happened and one of the people on the trip told us at the meeting this morning. He ran two laps and at the takeout said he was very tired  and slumped forward in his  boat face first into the river. They got him out immediately and. Began CPR. He came to and they asked him if he knew where be was and he said he was floating. He lapsed back into unconsciousness and they resumed CPR. Ambulance  was there within 5 minutes and took over but were unsuccessful."
Anyone headed to wildcat

Cane Creek at Fall Creek Fall at a 1000 and going up this can't be right can it?

Border crossing was the worst ever; the cars were lined up for inspection in every bay so lost an hour! Wow that's the most flooding I've seen just south of Detroit! Cars way off in the fields, in the ditches and some facing backwards up against the median. The ditches were like streams!
Also Lots of construction on i75 ;(

How low can Baby Falls been run in a kayak?
Lime creek (first gorge) today was pretty sick, despite the lowish water. Adrenaline falls is something else when you see it in person. Another 6 foot wide creek for king Louie and you southeast boys.
Very cool day on the water yesterday. 
The 8 sq mile watershed for the Rocky river(of Chatham County) got 3" of water night before last. 
The first guy that dumped me in an open boat (BillC) called yesterday morning and said let's go, so we did 
Ran the Upper section with Bill and a couple other locals that grew up on that river. Don't think I've ever seen 2 guys drink so much beer and chain smoke dry cigarettes all the way down a river before!
Dale Briggs and Pamela Francies Maynard, Cory and Coy joined for the Lower and the Bitch of a hike back out. 
We had to get off the river for a huge thunderstorm to pass for about 30 minutes about halfway down the Lower. 
Slept real damn good last night!
I'm sure Dale will post a short, shaky vid of my entertainment later.
Rolling into Friendsville late tonight. Where the hell do I paddle tomorrow with all this water?

Necky Blunt C1 conversion
HYPE - âThe Blunt is all about serious creekin'...the blunt excels on everything from technical low volume steep creeks to huge volume flood runs. The Blunt has great speed for making those tough ferries above the big gnarly, and nails eddies as if your life depended on it. A big safe cockpit eases exits on those rare occasions when its time to punch of the boat and swim.â
SPECIFICATIONS - Length: 8'2" / Width: 25.2" / Volume: 76.1 gal / Cockpit Length: 33.9" / Cockpit Width: 16.1" / Paddler weight: 143 - 243 lbs
honestly, this boat moves & feels like an old-school whitewater canoe - stable, agile, comfortable - in an easy-to-transport (former) kayak hull! That's why I bought it. I just have to thin down my "stuff", or I'd hold onto it! (complementary "frankenskirt" included) $250

Watching the news: they were talking about the escaped convicts. Running video of the search, a car went by with a blue Option on it!
No words... except it's one of the funniest things I've ever seen
"The day after his wife disappeared in a canoe accident, an Anchorage man answered his door to find two grim-faced Alaska State Troopers. âWeâre sorry Mr. Wilkens, but we have some information about your wifeâ, said one of the troopers. 
âTell me! Did you find her?â, Wilkens exclaimed. The troopers looked at each other. One said, âWe have some bad news, some good news, and some really great news. Which would you like to hear first?â 
Fearing the worst, Mr. Wilkens said, âGive me the bad news first.â 
The trooper said, âIâm sorry to tell you, sir, but this morning we found your wifeâs body in Kachemak Bay .â âOh my God!â, exclaimed Wilkens. Swallowing hard, he asked, âWhatâs the good news?â 
The trooper continued, âWhen we pulled her up, she had 12 twenty-five-pound king crabs and 6 good-sized Dungeness crabs clinging to her, and we feel you are entitled to a share in the catch.â 
Stunned, Mr. Wilkens demanded, âIf thatâs the good news, then whatâs the great news?â
The trooper replied, âWeâre gonna pull her up again tomorrow.â

So now that the Ark is the highest its been in 20 years (and still not at its peak for the season), I finally understand why there arent alot of open boaters out here. the term "big water" is a bit of an understatement

I think this will make a fine canoe to fish from, what do yall think ?
Ok, I know it doesn't really count, but.....
Pulled into the play wave at NOC this afternoon. Right next to the 4 kuyaks whose total volume would fit in my front air bag. 
Said "excuse me, I'm just gonna peel out and get out of your way."  Proceeded to pull onto the wave for a quick surf that immediately buried the front of the Octane into a perfect ender. Landed on my side, rolled up (kinda sorta) and pulled away with my pump spraying steady. 
Swear to God, it felt like I knew what I was doing. 
No video, didn't happen. 
but I'll be smiling all the way back to flatlandville tonight!
What glue should I use to stick vinyl ring patches to triple laminate polyethylene hulls on some OT Discoveries. I'm thinking the red can weldwood will work, but I'm not sure. Thoughts? Input?

You guys talk about the class 3 Upper Yough a lot, figured this'd be the place to ask.

I'm a Green local and butt boater who'll find himself in the area the 1st of July.

I have, with my amazing detective skills, discerned that a release is scheduled said day.  However I am unable to find exact time frames.  Also, where might I find adventurous companions to join me on my quest?

Sincerely,
Your Beater.
Rubber pushers ain't always smart, even if it's "canoe" rubber. #beaters

How do people carry spares in an Octane 92 btw.. my usual place on the sides behind the sidewalls is too short to get my two piece into. Any hints or ideas?
Okay, I think I have the funds for some Fall Line Airbags.  

I want to make sure I get them right though.  I have seen some airbags with extra pockets.

Can ya'll tell me which pockets you have, and for what reason, plus if you could do over, which pockets you would add?

I'm pretty sure I would like a pocket in the bow, to store sunscreen, ear and eye drops, etc.   Contemplating the Spare Paddle Bag, but not sure how easy it would be to use, versus other options.  What do ya'll use your Stern pockets for?

Any info greatly appreciated. A big chunk of money and I want to do it right.

Can message me if you prefer
Someone hit the Norse paddle mother lode... anyone interested? at 29 EUR a pop, I bet these would even be worth reimporting to the US for anyone looking for an indestructible paddle. They double as excellent personal protection devices as well. In Germany.. 


Picked up a plastic welder now I need some broken boats to practice welding  / get welding rods from.  Anyone around Knox, Ocoee, Cleveland, chatty
Pass it around, it is for a good cause....... I have no idea what it may be but dammit is is a good cause.
I'm going to be in Taos New Mexico in early August without a boat for some family stuff.  Does anyone know any open boaters out there who wouldn't mind bumming me some gear and showing me down a run or two?
I'm looking at a Dagger Impulse... Any thoughts on this craft? Good for a beginner? Thirteen footer...
Anyone coming north soon?  UY run,  maybe? 
Need a ride for new canoe saddle made  by Matt Todhunter. Gracias!!

I have a youth Astral Otter PFD for sale in good condition if anyone needs one..  $40
So, Soapstone Valley Creek goes with only three/four wood portages--I had to put in a bit lower than what I would have liked.   This was a major elf run but the class III III+ drops all had plenty of water and were loads of fun.  That said, you want an inch of rain in less than an hour and you want to put on while the rain is still coming down pretty hard.  I think we can get to of those three drops cleared out though--it would be some work, but worth it as they are in good drops.
Some Scottish Ditch running...
Russell Fork is runnn at 204 CFS.....just sayin
Old school.....
Alright Keith Clark here it is with the Cascades releases all of them from 1600 till 1900 weekdays only except for the two in Sept. NOC set them up this way so their guides could boat after their raft trips. The good thing is that they are all barefoot weather days.
note: Paul Scriver was the co-pilot on this comic.
Does anyone have a 91 octane that my friend can demo Sunday ? He lives in Chattanooga and I'm going to take him to the nanty to paddle it .

I have a new AB paddle with white blade.  Need to cut it down in length and trim the blade so it isn't too large for Kailee.  She is 10 and only weighs about 70 pounds.  Also need to take out T-Grip and reinstall it on the shorter shaft.  Comfortable doing everything except the T-Grip.  How can it be taken out without dama
